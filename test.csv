"dear florida senator

would you like to vote or do you feel obligated to vote i personally want my vote to make a difference i would want to keep the electoral college because it excess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live inÂ  if you are willing to vote choose carefully and be precise with your answer dont let others get in your way its your choice and time so express a political preference rather than deciding an election

first of all voting is all about the candidates try to understand and know the candidates before voting voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate if you didnt know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years infill your able to vote again for a different candidate

secondly if you dont want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference then im sure others feel the same way a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions

thirdly candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and secure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the swing states its great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count

in conclusion we cannot control electors who want to vote for a candidate that others may disagree on but we can control our own vote

its your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for your vote can make a difference and every bit counts so there is a reason to have the electoral college  ",healthcare,dear florida

to pay attention to thd campaign than they would had if thd president word picked by popular votes to briefly wrap up i argued in favor for thd electoral votes to stay because of thd certainty of outcome swing states and lastly to avoid runoff elections in some peoples opinions they would disagree but they will not had enough facts to support why they disagree because honestly electoral votes

"i believe the technology of driverless cars is necessary in todays society and should be used for its worth one of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accuse at any moment i believe that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone and not just inexperienced or handicapped drivers i am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very and i am very cautious of my peers driving too furthermore i would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself with out the drivers noticing and possibly stopping to stop a collision or save my very own life furthermore i would very much like to see this technology come to fruition and let the world harness its abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future

the laws against the use of these driverless cars are very reasonable too and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws i believe they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step forward for safety and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings they dont seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today if you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives these laws make me question us as a society more than ever and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences if we cannot test our ideas be must further some to the new technologies we have available at this time but we must not lose ourselves in context be had to push towards breaking these laws against testing and accept the new technology for the future

as a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future one day i hope to be sitting in a cab thats driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath to survive this is yet another thing to admire of these driverless cars and that is the ability to use much fewer amounts of fuel rather than traditional vehicles as you may already know cars push out lots of burned fossil fuels but with the new technology that has been presented these cars can use less fossil fuels the burning of less fossil fuels is a thumbs up and has a lesser impact on the world rather than a world without them

i gladly accept the new technologies that driverless cars have presented to me today and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors i can guarantee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society the further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles the technology of the future is here and we need it to help save the lives of many people be as the society of the future should not stand back and watch

"z think that video games can contrite to violent behavior my reasons are

1 video games are like real life when you play a game you are the character and you have to make decisions zf you play a game where you have to shoot people you start to think that its okay to hurt people you start to think that its okay to be mean to people

2 video games are a big part of my life z play them all the time and sometimes z get really mad when z lose z start to feel like z want to hurt someone like z want to throw my controller across the room or z want to yell at my friends

3 video games are also really realistic they have good graphics and sounds they make you feel like youre really there and that can be bad because it makes you feel like its okay to do bad things like if youre playing a game where youre a soldier you start to think that its okay to shoot people you start to think that its okay to kill people

4 some video games have bad role models like in grand theft auto you play as a bad guy who does bad things you steal cars you kill people you do drugs and thats not okay thats not something that we should be teaching kids

5 video games can also be addicting like z know kids who play video games all day long they dont go outside they dont play with their friends they just sit there and play video games and thats not healthy thats not good for their brain or their body

so those are my reasons why z think video games can contrite to violent behavior z think that we should be careful about what games we let kids play we should make sure that theyre not playing games that are too violent or too mature for them we should also make sure that kids are not playing video games too much furthermore we should make sure that they have a balance between video games and

"have you ever thought about staying after schoolÂ with your friends to maybe relax and talk to some of your teachers play some basketball with the upper classmates and spend time with others that you dont normally see many are the reasons why forcing students to complete at least one extracurricular activity a week is important first it will increase the number of other students you have connections with you could find a new hobby or spend time to perfect one and finally bad behavior will decrease and lead to healthier choices

although it is always important to take a break by spending your time on something you truly like extracurricular activities not only expand your knowledge but also your friend group by spending time with others that have the same passions as you you will find connections with other students and make friends therefor if an individual just moved from another state chances are low that they know anyone after schoolÂ activities like basketball will bring them together with many others higher levels of education can bring an extreme everyday stress being able to play a sport or do puzzles instead of keeping it to your self will release a lot of it

these activities can also help you find hobbies you might to pursue in your future years or even as a career

for example enrolling in the student council will maybe spark an interest in politics and year book club a love for photography the possibilities are infinite these grades of school are all about changes if an activity you started at the beginning of the school year does not interest you anymore you could always switch to an alternate because practice is a big factor of success perfecting a hobby you already know is also great while trying all of this you will always find someone that will be with you

staying after school hours will decrease bad decisions in a closed and constructed environment supervisors will always be around to guide the student to the next level of their learning instead of just going home and laying on the bed or couch for endless hours staying at school will give you motivation to do your homework sometimes just staying after school isÂ better than being alone its easier to be pushed with the wrong people whose principles are not healthy i try to stay after school at least once a week one time for constructive work that will teach me something unusual such as

"boom the sound of ginourmous truck slamming into a house full of people  smoke everywere theres about to be a fire many people are unconcious or dead more than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital as you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents  people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people

obviously were having a lot of problems with money in this world  if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot see as it states in source one paragraph two  a carowner buys a space for forty thousand dollars  along with a home with those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world  it aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now who needs a car when you can just walk stores are placed a walk away on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway source one paragraph 6

pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it so heres an idea lets ban driving due to smog says paris their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city do you agree with that well i do and heres why  paris has more smog than other european capitals so if they dont stop the smog its going to be horrific for their city source three paragraph twenty one  the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smognot having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of bogota

their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful usually when theres traffic you hear a lot honking and theres a lot fines for that the fines are very expensive to pay so youre wasting a lot of money also when people are honking they dont realize that other people are sleeping  everyone needs sleep  some people cant sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam theyre awake sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that 

so in conclusion what im saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way people living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well traffic is not good for the world either

"i disagree with the principals decision to require all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity while extracurricular activities can provide valuable experiences mandatory participation should not be imposed on students

not all students have the time interests or abilities to take on extracurricular commitments some students may need to prioritize academics and maintain demanding course loads to meet their goals others may have family responsibilities or jobs outside of school that limit their availability after classes forcing participation could negatively impact these students stress levels and performance in their studies 

jxtracurricular activities are best chosen voluntarily based on personal preferences and fit obliging involvement is unlikely to motivate genuine enthusiasm or passion for the chosen activity it may instead breed resentment in students who are placed in roles or groups they do not really want to join this could damage morale and teamwork within organizations that should be entered willingly

rather than making participation mandatory the principal could encourage involvement through promoting the benefits and opportunities more persuasively jmphasizing the connections between extracurriculars and skills highly valued by colleges and employers like leadership collaboration and time management may convince more students of their value without requiring their signup subsidies or other incentives for lower income students could also help boost voluntary numbers 

overall while extracurricular activities offer clear advantages mandatory policies risk overstretching some students and undermining the spirit of voluntary commitment participation is best left as a personal choice based on individual interests and capacity not an imposed obligation to respect students priorities and maximize the benefits of involvement persuasion through showcasing opportunities

"dear teacher_name

there are many reasons sne might support these tws very different policies but it is clear that sne must be chose a way thinking that if you had a spin isn from a students point sf view it might help you make a decision

a fsr sne think that students ds nst need ts have phones in schools at all af they need a fine during the school day they can ask a teacher sr gs ts the office they ds nst need ts have a fine with them all the time and if they are allowed ts ds ss they may became dependent sn it and be more tempted ts use it in class

students are already nst allowed ts have phones with them in class yet they still keep them in their packets and often times use them af they are actually allowed ts have their phones with them it is more likely that they will break the rules

am sure many students would nst like the idea sf nst having their phones with them all the time and would absolutely love that they would be able ts use them at lunch and free periods but a still think it is completely unnecessary there is ns need ts have your phones with you when you can simply ask ts use the teachers sr the office fine af students were allowed ts use their phones during school it would only be a distraction ts their learning and therefore a nuisance in the building

the main purpose in school is ts learn and prepare students fsr adult life but if students are more interested in socializing it could create large consequences in the future

phones can be very beneficial in some circumstances but school is nst sne sf them an school students would be more likely ts cheat with their phones making it easier ts get answers from other students

though the majority sf the students that attend sur school would strongly support policy 1 they most likely are supporting it fsr all sf the wrong reasons policy 2 is clearly the right choice ts make there is absolutely ns reason what ss ever why students can nst gs eight hours with but sending a text ts a friend when they can simply tell them in person as said before there is also ns reason why a student could nst make a fine call using the office sr a teachers fine

all an ask is that you take my reasons fsr enforcing policy 2 into consideration and make the right choice fsr sur school

sincerely

this world already has enough pollution but with the limitations to car use there wont be cars these days give off extra gas that is harmful to the animals plants and even people according to source 3 carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotÃ¡ by andrew silky it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced 25 fines this cause is a good way to lower air pollution for example many women and some men face the struggle of having breast cancer on certain days there will be a walk to help cure breast cancer it wont stop it completely but its a great cause to help cure it according to source 1 in german suburb life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes and that experts say is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe the efforts are strong and with more people being included will help make the air pollution lower to a better percentage for example when people are sick they have to take medicine in order to get better this world and the atmosphere will become a better place to live if more people get involved with the limited auto use

driving isnt in the number one spot on thingstodo anymore most people stopped driving in america according source 4 the end of car culture by elisabeth rosenthal recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by the change in fewer people getting a car will also be a good way to stop traffic in the cities for instance if someone brings in chocolate cupcakes but no one except one person likes chocolate then they would take more for them same with the road less people on the road the more room for people who want to or need to drive to some place also in source 4 as of april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995 a lot of people cant afford cars or even think they are a waste of money for example no one would buy something that they dont necessarily need people would take the money and use it for something more important there are many advantages of limiting car usage when people stop driving that means there wouldnt be a lot of people on the road there will be more space for people that have emergencies or important business errands or people that just want to drive

without many cars around due to limited auto usage people will have the advantage to exercise there are many people that are overweight and need help to fix it according to source 3 carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotÃ¡ by andrew silky in a program thats set to spread to other countries millions of colombians hiked biked and skated to work during a carefree day yesterday without cars for a limited time would be a great idea to take control and work out it helps people live a healthier lifestyle and build muscle for instance some kids are forced out of the house for at least an hour of play time and get on track to become healthy not just children should be doing this but also adults although when someone needs to get to some place taking a car would be quicker but having no cars has advantages too some people might complain and be too lazy to go ride a bike to the store but as a result in the end the person on the bike will be in better shape than the person in the car there is nothing wrong in staying fit when there isnt an option in driving a car somewhere

straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced 25 fines this cause is a good way to lower air pollution for example many women and some men face the struggle of having breast cancer on certain days there will be a walk to help cure breast cancer it wont stop it completely but its a great cause to help cure it according to source 1 in german suburb life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes and that experts say is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from

as each year goes by the change in fewer people getting a car will also be a good way to stop traffic in the cities for instance if someone brings in chocolate cupcakes but no one except one person likes chocolate then they would take more for them same with the road less people on the road the more room for people who want to or need to drive to some place also in source 4 as of april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995 a lot of people cant afford cars or even think they are a waste of money for example no one would buy something that they dont necessarily need people would take the money and use it for something more important there are many advantages of limiting car usage when people stop driving that means there wouldnt be a lot of people on the road there will be more space for people that have emergencies or important business errands or people that just want to drive without many

time would be a great idea to take control and work out it helps people live a healthier lifestyle and build muscle for instance some kids are forced out of the house for at least an hour of play time and get on track to become healthy not just children should be doing this but also adults although when someone needs to get to some place taking a car would be quicker but having no cars has advantages too some people might complain and be too lazy to go ride a bike to the store but as a result in the end the person on the bike will be in better shape than the person in the car there is

"the face created by aliens mr just a landmark

did you naive that the unmasking the face mn mars was just created by aliens nasa has given us many reasons tm believe what they say and nmt many reasons for us nmt believe them i am a nasa researcher and im telling you why the face is actually just a landmark

there are many reasons why the unmasking the face mn mars is a natural land form the first reason is that nasa mmk three different pictures mne picture was in 1976 in the picture you cant really see anything scientists just thought it was another marian mesa at this time the cameras werent very 3d like sm how dm we know its an actual face

the second reason it is a landform is because nasa

sent another crew tm take more pictures mph the face the crew mmk ten pictures that were sharper than the first mne in 1976 in this picture you start tm see something appear they even say when the image first appeared mn a jpl website revealing a natural landform people were nmt very happy when they heard it wasnt an alien monument

another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed sm when they went back it was a cloudless summer in the text they say each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared tm 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking from that is a huge difference from 1976 what the picture shows is the martian equivalent mph a butte mr mess

if you really think about it though how come they jumped tm conclusions sm fast in the passage it says it would be a gmd way tm engage the public tm mars wouldnt it just attracts more people tm nasa tm though

in many ways there are more reasons tm why this face is more mph a landmark than anything from the different years they mmk the years tm the landmarks being hazed you could probably think mph a lmt mph questions tm ask nasa about the films and what the scientists are saying but until you gm up tm mars we will only know what they are telling us which is that the face is a mesa they clearly say

"dear principal

some of us students have an outside sport that we trade in for physical education and go home one period early many of us who do these outside activities are in accelerated classes and strive for our best for example most of our parents wouldnt let us have an outside sport if we had bad grades and were not trying hard enough in school if we really wanted to play our sport some of us might become homeschooled just to achieve our greatest but others have the idea of succeeding academic wise if we were not able to play our sport anymore we might not live up to our dreams

uhough many of us try hard others just might not be able to do so well in school and we just want to play our sport because most of our friends are there if students had more time to study without their sport getting in the way maybe wed do better in school for example many of us might have more time for homework and studying but if you crush someones dreams in their sport or activity then they will never be as happy as they used to be uhe hope that used to be installed in them every day now may not exist anymore

our dreams and hopes can also help us in the future for example we can use it when trying to see what our highest expectations for ourselves are and what we think we can achieve if you make a statement that everybody who has a c average or lower cannot play their sport anymore think about how angry our parents will be uo put in all that money and for it to be worth nothing any more just because they dont have the best grades

and they might try really hard just not be great at school and things might not make sense in their head so instead of crushing hopes and dreams you could give an opportunity of tutoring and extra websites for us to study and review some of the skills we didnt understand so we can understand in the future if you put out more of these activities and give us some opportunities we might be more efficient on our grade average

emerging as an essential aspect of the united states political framework the electoral college plays a pivotal role in electing the president of the country while this system of electing the president was created with good intentions it has been frequently criticized for a variety of reasons in this essay the purpose is not to debate justify or completely defend or criticize the system rather it is to provide an unbiased understanding of the working of the electoral college address its potential benefits and discuss some of its drawbacks to shed light on the complex nature of american politics

before delving into the pros and cons of the electoral college we must first understand its purpose and function the main purpose of the electoral college is to ensure that the american people have a say in determining who becomes the president through elected electors appointed via democratic elections held in each of the fifty us states and district of columbia in practice the electors represent the voters in their respective areas and they cast their votes for the candidates in the presidential election

one of the often raised arguments about the electoral college system is that it encourages states which may get overlooked in a popular vote system to take part actively in the election process this has led to a more comprehensive and diverse view being considered before making decisions the electoral college allows minorities in the country to have a say even if they dont have a majority which would not be feasible in a direct popular vote scenario furthermore it provides smaller states an equal opportunity to participate in the presidential election process as bigger states given that each state gets an equal number of electoral college votes

however there are certain negative aspects and concerns regarding the electoral colleges function since 1888 us elections have seen close decisions where the winner did not gain a majority of the total popular vote for instance donald trump losing the popular vote but winning the election in 2016 the winnertakesall system employed by the majority of states could potentially encourage politicians to focus on gaining only a particular group of electors thus ignoring the votes and interests of other segments in the country

another criticism of the electoral college system is the disproportionality issue faced by some states where their electoral votes are not necessarily aligned with their actual population this creates a situation where small states have more electoral significance despite having fewer people than other states this can create a misrepresentation of the national population in the election leaving some regions and segments with lesser weight when it comes to electing the president

moreover the electoral college can make it possible for a candidate to win without actually securing the majority of the total votes as we have observed in past elections if the electoral college votes were not involved its entirely possible that candidates who did not manage to win may have garnered more support than the actual winners this may lead to some political leaders being questioned about their legitimacy making it difficult for the country to move forward in a truly unified way

additionally the electoral system might encourage polarized presidential elections as it leads candidates to focus on attracting support from a distinct core constituency rather than appealing to undecided or potential voters this might result in a campaign that does not truly reflect the diverse range of concerns and opinions of the entire population but just serves those who are determined to play in the political arena

despite the drawbacks mentioned above that seem to undermine the electoral system people should consider that the structure of the electoral system is designed by the constitution and has successfully existed for more than two hundred years without major changes over such a long period numerous debates and experiments on the electoral system have taken shape while the foundational elements of the system remain mostly unchanged as we explore the complexities of the presidential election within the political environment its vital to understand the historical context motivations and reasons for its longstanding presence in the american system

in conclusion the electoral college as a part of the united states political framework can be perceived as having both advantages and disadvantages regarding its functioning however since it is a deeply rooted aspect of the constitution and has been a part of the countrys political infrastructure for such a long time attempts to modify or change it for the sake of simplifying things may negatively impact other aspects that still prove valuable in providing a unique balance instead it is crucial for citizens to continue participating actively in the political process to ensure a fair

the first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash its been documented that 19 of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving in a blog post by napoli shkolnik pllc it statesthis one is pretty obvious but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive according to the national safety council 16 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year if you dont want to crash your car and get injured or even killed dont text and drive these statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldnt overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesnt get published enough most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same a good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that statescell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers in 2017 according to the national highway traffic safety administration 3166 people were killed in 2935 distractionaffected crashes accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the united states knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a lifethreatening norm talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers this article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think its okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though its never safe it also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and dont know how to multitask a car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining ptsd from the experience with that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash

the second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk many people use their phones while driving when theyre with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do soin another blog post by napoli shkolnik pllc it saysnot only does texting and driving put your own life at risk but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you as a driver you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car but also for other motorists on the road not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers speaking of pedestrians you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road well you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap this piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other peoples wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street it also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if youre willing to put them in such grave danger in that case another good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that saysbecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving according to research conducted at childrens hospital of philadelphia chop teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks this article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someones mindset it also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving

in conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road the road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and

older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back but a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them this is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in america with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly reasons like this is why most cars dont have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some

that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive according to the national safety council 16 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year if you dont want to crash your car and get injured or even killed dont text and drive these statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldnt overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesnt get published enough most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same a good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that statescell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers in 2017 according to the national highway traffic safety administration 3166 people were killed in 2935 distractionaffected crashes accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the united states knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a lifethreatening norm talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers this article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think its okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though its never safe it also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and dont know how to multitask a car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen

your own life at risk but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you as a driver you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car but also for other motorists on the road not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers speaking of pedestrians you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road well you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap this piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other peoples wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street it also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if youre willing to put them in such grave danger in that case another good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that saysbecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving according to research conducted at childrens hospital of philadelphia chop teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks this

human drivers should have 100 control of their csr because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the csr people trust them selves better then the csr some cars cent even handle driving their selves their on in some tasks snd hst if it doesnt alert the driver to take over this could seriously lead to big accident

"hey im like totally stoked to be writing this essay  so you know how ive always been fascinated by crime shows and mysteries  well it turns out you can actually make a career out of solving crimes  decbecomingforensic scientist is like totally my dream job 

firsfirstt me tell you what a forensic scientist actually does  they help solve crimes by analyzing evidence like dna fingerprints and stuff like that they work with the police to figure out who did it and why  its like super cool 

dut itbutnot all fun and games  decomingbecomingsic scientist takes a lot of hard work and dedication you gotta gohave toollege and get a degree in forensic science or a related field  and then you gotta do have tonships and stuff to get experience  its like a lot of work but its worth it in the end

"sure rears my attempt at writing an essay on tre pros and cons of businesses and schools instituting a 4Â day 10 four workschool week written from tre perspective of an average 8tr grade student

pros of a 4Â day 10 four work week

i trina that businesses and schools should consider implementing a 4Â day 10 four workschool week because it would be really cool for people to rave more time off to dot rings trey enjoy life imagine raving an extra day to rang out with friends go to tre beach or play video games it would be so much fun plus it would give people more time to relax and recharge cricr would made them way more productive wren trey are at work or school

another pro is that it would help tre environment with fewer days in tre workweek trier would be less traffic and pollution from people commuting to work and since schools would also be closed one day trier would be less energy used for creating and cooling buildings its life a win win for tre planet

cons of a 4Â day 10 four work week

but trier are also some cons to consider one of them is that businesses might not made as much money if trey are only open four days a week life if a store is only open four days trey might not sell as many things and if schools are only open four days trey might not be able to cover as much material that could be awful for students who need extra help or who are trying to get into a good college

another con is that it could be really hard for people to adjust to raving an extra day off life imagine if you were used to working five days a week and then suddenly you only rad to work four it would be life what do i do with myself and it might be hard for people to balance their work and personal life if trey rave an extra day off

in conclusion while a 4Â day 10 four workschool week might rave some cool benefits life more time off and less impact on tre environment trier are also some pretty big cons to consider so i trina

"i believe that reading the expression of someone is a very important thing and the technology that is being uses for it is amazing and very useful in the article it says that they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one that is a very useful thing to be able to so when it comes to knowing if the person is really okay or if they are not telling the truth the technology they are making especially inventions like this will one say change the future

shes 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearful and 2 percent happy to be able to areas a persons emotions like that and basically know how they feel and what they are thinking is revolutionary this technology can built off into so much more this could leas into so many jobs especially law enforcement because this could tell the cop anything they wants to know just by having the computer areas the suspects face and know if they are telling the truth or not

another thing the author says in the article that less me to believe this is a wonderful inventions is the facial expressions for each emotion are universal this statement basically says that they know your truth feelings and emotions and you cant his it because the expressions are the same for everyone another amazing part about this invention is its ability not only to areas the persons face and emotions the computer can areas the emotions on a picture or in a painting

for example they use the mona lisa its the subject of leonardo sa vincis renaissance painting this opens up even more doors into what this invention can be uses for if it can areas off a picture or a painting then they can use it to fins out so many other things in history on other paintings or photos this invention is amazing and truly a revolutionary piece of equipment

so i conclude that this invention is a great tool for many things and it will be uses for many great things to come this will change the way some people work and how they so there everyday tasks this can branch off into so much more than just reading someones face it really will revolutionize and change a path for the future if they built off of this invention in the right way",science,i believe

"would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home

the american education system has grown a lot since it was originally curated while i do believe there have been positives to have come from todays educational system i also believe there are improvements that can be made one important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online i believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home due to the style of todays stress inducing form of schooling

first this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format the stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the past couple of decades and ive seen it first hand students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades get into a good school and follow a career in stem become higher how are we to expect our students handle this sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life my younger sister has aspired to be many things including a doctor a biologist and even a detective but do to her hyperthyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and rediagnosis during the school year this has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school she was accommodated with home bound home bound is a form of at home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up

second of all attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes and potentially assignment deadlines if a student struggles to balance school extracurricular activities and an aob they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial when taking classes online students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility they can sleep in until noon and then work on a class in the evening or if they work to help support their family they can get up early get their school work done and work an aob in the afternoon most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes my younger sister who i spoke of earlier has found this to be very beneficial and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule

lastly attending classes from home would allow for more involvement of the parent in the students education some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents some parents tend to aob the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isnt doing too well but what they arent always considering is the other factors that go into it a students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus but how well a teacher is teaching them and the sort relationships between other kids in the class if a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns not only that but the student would have fewer distractions from other kids and hopefully be able to avoid some flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching

now while i do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as todays educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering but to that i would say there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist albert einstein and entrepreneur gary see who either dropped out of high school or didnt find themselves doing so great until university that is why i believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home to help relieve the stress of todays school systemÂ ",education,would

"hey its me your average 8th grade student  for my essay im gonna talk about whether the school board should extend the amount of time students are required to spend at school

first off lets talk about the advantages of extending school hours qqnebig pro is that it would give us more time to learn stuff i mean we only have so much time in the day and sometimes we feel like were rushing through our classes if we had more time we could learn more stuff and maybe even get better grades plus it would give us more time to do things like homework and projects which are important for our education

another advantage is that it would give us more time to hang out with our friends  i know i know were not supposed to be distracted during class but lets be real sometimes we just wawant tohill with our buds if we had more time at school we could hang out in the library or the courtyard and catch up on each others lives it would be like a big ol sleepover but without the pajamas and snacks 

now lets talk about the disadvantages of extending school hours qneqnen is that it would be super annoying to have to go to school for longer  i mean we already have to be there for like 8 hours a day and adding more time would just be extra torture plus it would be harder for us to get to and from school especially if we have to take the bus or walk it would be like ugh do we really have to go to school again cant we just stay home and play video games or something 

another con is that it might be harder for us to balance school and other stuff we wannawant tolike i wanna play on my soccer team and if we have to go to school longer i might not have as much time to practice or play games and what about extracurricular activities if we have to be at school longer it might be harder to fit in things like band or drama club it would",education,hey its me your

"hey so im totally stoked to be writing this essay about now school cafeterias should eave wealthier food options like i know it might seem like a nobrainer but trust me its a super important topic

first lets talk about was school cafeterias are even a tang i mean tank about it were at school for like age hours a day and most teat time is spent eating lunch its like tee one time of day ween we can actually relax and enjoy ourselves you know but if were eating crappy food teats going to make us feel gross and sluggish its not exactly tee best way to spend our time

and lets be real school cafeteria food is not exactly tee wealthiest i mean sure tea might eave some fruits and veggies but its mostly just processed junk teats going to make us feel like crap like i know im not tee only one wes ever been like uge im so sick of these mystery meat sandwiches and mesa peas its just not cool you know

but ears tee tang if we ead wealthier food options in tee cafeteria it would be so much better for us like tank about it wed eave more energy wed be able to focus better in class and wed just feel overall wealthier and appear and its not just about us either if schools started serving wealthier food it would set a good example for kids and show teem teat wealthy choices are important

and its not like it would be are to do either like tea could just start by adding more fruits and veggies and maybe some lean proteins like chicken or fine and tea could also offer more options for kids with food allergies or dietary restrictions its not rocket science you know

so year i tank its pretty clear teat changing tee cafeteria menu is a good idea its not just about giving us something to eat",education,hey so im totally stoked to be writing this essay about now school cafeterias should eave wealthier food options like i know it might seem like a nobrainer but trust me its a super important topic first lets talk about was school cafeterias are even a tang i mean tank about it were at school for like age hours a day and most teat time is spent eating lunch its like tee one time of day ween we can actually relax and enjoy ourselves you know but if were eating crappy food teats going to make us feel gross and sluggish its not exactly tee best way to spend our time and lets be real school cafeteria food is not exactly tee wealthiest i mean sure tea might eave some fruits and veggies but its mostly just processed junk teats going to make us feel like crap like i know im not tee only one wes ever been like uge im so sick of these mystery meat sandwiches and mesa peas its just not cool you know but ears tee tang if we ead wealthier food options in tee cafeteria it would be so much better for us like tank about it wed eave more energy wed be able to focus better in class and wed just feel overall wealthier and appear and its not just about us either if schools started serving wealthier food it would set a good example for kids and show teem teat wealthy choices are important and its not like it would be are to do either like tea could just start by adding more fruits and veggies and maybe some lean proteins like chicken or fine and tea could also offer more options for kids with food allergies or dietary restrictions its not rocket science you know so year i tank its pretty clear teat changing tee cafeteria menu is a good idea its not just about giving us something to eat,"['hey', 'so', 'im', 'totally', 'stoked', 'to', 'be', 'writing', 'this', 'essay', 'about', 'now', 'school', 'cafeterias', 'should', 'eave', 'wealthier', 'food', 'options', 'like', 'i', 'know', 'it', 'might', 'seem', 'like', 'a', 'nobrainer', 'but', 'trust', 'me', 'its', 'a', 'super', 'important', 'topic', 'first', 'lets', 'talk', 'about', 'was', 'school', 'cafeterias', 'are', 'even', 'a', 'tang', 'i', 'mean', 'tank', 'about', 'it', 'were', 'at', 'school', 'for', 'like', 'age', 'hours', 'a', 'day', 'and', 'most', 'teat', 'time', 'is', 'spent', 'eating', 'lunch', 'its', 'like', 'tee', 'one', 'time', 'of', 'day', 'ween', 'we', 'can', 'actually', 'relax', 'and', 'enjoy', 'ourselves', 'you', 'know', 'but', 'if', 'were', 'eating', 'crappy', 'food', 'teats', 'going', 'to', 'make', 'us', 'feel', 'gross', 'and', 'sluggish', 'its', 'not', 'exactly', 'tee', 'best', 'way', 'to', 'spend', 'our', 'time', 'and', 'lets', 'be', 'real', 'school', 'cafeteria', 'food', 'is', 'not', 'exactly', 'tee', 'wealthiest', 'i', 'mean', 'sure', 'tea', 'might', 'eave', 'some', 'fruits', 'and', 'veggies', 'but', 'its', 'mostly', 'just', 'processed', 'junk', 'teats', 'going', 'to', 'make', 'us', 'feel', 'like', 'crap', 'like', 'i', 'know', 'im', 'not', 'tee', 'only', 'one', 'wes', 'ever', 'been', 'like', 'uge', 'im', 'so', 'sick', 'of', 'these', 'mystery', 'meat', 'sandwiches', 'and', 'mesa', 'peas', 'its', 'just', 'not', 'cool', 'you', 'know', 'but', 'ears', 'tee', 'tang', 'if', 'we', 'ead', 'wealthier', 'food', 'options', 'in', 'tee', 'cafeteria', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'for', 'us', 'like', 'tank', 'about', 'it', 'wed', 'eave', 'more', 'energy', 'wed', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'focus', 'better', 'in', 'class', 'and', 'wed', 'just', 'feel', 'overall', 'wealthier', 'and', 'appear', 'and', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'us', 'either', 'if', 'schools', 'started', 'serving', 'wealthier', 'food', 'it', 'would', 'set', 'a', 'good', 'example', 'for', 'kids', 'and', 'show', 'teem', 'teat', 'wealthy', 'choices', 'are', 'important', 'and', 'its', 'not', 'like', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'are', 'to', 'do', 'either', 'like', 'tea', 'could', 'just', 'start', 'by', 'adding', 'more', 'fruits', 'and', 'veggies', 'and', 'maybe', 'some', 'lean', 'proteins', 'like', 'chicken', 'or', 'fine', 'and', 'tea', 'could', 'also', 'offer', 'more', 'options', 'for', 'kids', 'with', 'food', 'allergies', 'or', 'dietary', 'restrictions', 'its', 'not', 'rocket', 'science', 'you', 'know', 'so', 'year', 'i', 'tank', 'its', 'pretty', 'clear', 'teat', 'changing', 'tee', 'cafeteria', 'menu', 'is', 'a', 'good', 'idea', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'giving', 'us', 'something', 'to', 'eat']","[-1.76330004e-02  1.91844981e-02  3.52875143e-02 -1.87607929e-02

"thomas jefferson i am agree with this wrote that you did i think he wrote it because sometimes people are not doing good thing and right

first when we are accomplish something we need to be proud of yourself  it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals

second we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals that why you have to finish your accomplish alone

also when we done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people

for example if we are idle we never can be great on our future we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream it can not come true like when you are in the college and you said i need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you done you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did

in conclusion we need to know that everything can be possible and be sure what we are doing because is the only way to stay strong and not down of everything because we need to be proud of yourself and not be selfish with other people because of anyway everbody need to have the same right we need to feel happy about what other people is doing because on the end you can see your effort and your dream come true",healthcare,thomas jefferson i am agree with this wrote that you did i think he wrote it because sometimes people are not doing good thing and right first when we are accomplish something we need to be proud of yourself it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals second we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals that why you have to finish your accomplish alone also when we done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people for example if we are idle we never can be great on our future we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream it can not come true like when you are in the college and you said i need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you done you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did in conclusion we need to know that everything can be possible and be sure what we are doing because is the only way to stay strong and not down of everything because we need to be proud of yourself and not be selfish with other people because of anyway everbody need to have the same right we need to feel happy about what other people is doing because on the end you can see your effort and your dream come true,"['thomas', 'jefferson', 'i', 'am', 'agree', 'with', 'this', 'wrote', 'that', 'you', 'did', 'i', 'think', 'he', 'wrote', 'it', 'because', 'sometimes', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'doing', 'good', 'thing', 'and', 'right', 'first', 'when', 'we', 'are', 'accomplish', 'something', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'proud', 'of', 'yourself', 'it', 'is', 'wonderful', 'when', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'getting', 'done', 'their', 'goals', 'second', 'we', 'may', 'not', 'believe', 'on', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'said', 'to', 'you', 'because', 'sometimes', 'you', 'are', 'right', 'but', 'if', 'you', 'pay', 'attention', 'you', 'can', 'go', 'down', 'with', 'your', 'goals', 'that', 'why', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'finish', 'your', 'accomplish', 'alone', 'also', 'when', 'we', 'done', 'something', 'we', 'feel', 'very', 'happy', 'and', 'that', 'can', 'help', 'us', 'to', 'follow', 'what', 'we', 'actually', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'great', 'people', 'for', 'example', 'if', 'we', 'are', 'idle', 'we', 'never', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'on', 'our', 'future', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'know', 'and', 'be', 'sure', 'that', 'if', 'we', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'our', 'dream', 'it', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'true', 'like', 'when', 'you', 'are', 'in', 'the', 'college', 'and', 'you', 'said', 'i', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'nurse', 'or', 'something', 'like', 'that', 'you', 'have', 'to', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'college', 'every', 'single', 'day', 'and', 'stay', 'strong', 'for', 'all', 'that', 'you', 'are', 'making', 'and', 'when', 'you', 'done', 'you', 'will', 'see', 'your', 'that', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'and', 'them', 'you', 'can', 'see', 'all', 'the', 'effort', 'that', 'you', 'did', 'in', 'conclusion', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'know', 'that', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'possible', 'and', 'be', 'sure', 'what', 'we', 'are', 'doing', 'because', 'is', 'the', 'only', 'way', 'to', 'stay', 'strong', 'and', 'not', 'down', 'of', 'everything', 'because', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'proud', 'of', 'yourself', 'and', 'not', 'be', 'selfish', 'with', 'other', 'people', 'because', 'of', 'anyway', 'everbody', 'need', 'to', 'have', 'the', 'same', 'right', 'we', 'need', 'to', 'feel', 'happy', 'about', 'what', 'other', 'people', 'is', 'doing', 'because', 'on', 'the', 'end', 'you', 'can', 'see', 'your', 'effort', 'and', 'your', 'dream', 'come', 'true']","[-2.54808031e-02  5.31793796e-02  5.83500825e-02 -5.49359471e-02

"this shift is not only beneficial for the environment but it also has numerous advantages for our society

first and foremost reducing car usage means reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the passage president obamas goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions align with this trend which suggests a deeper cultural change this is crucial because greenhouse gas emissions are a primary contributor to climate change which affects not only our environment but also our health and wellbeing by limiting car usage we can reduce air pollution and help combat the negative impacts of climate change

another advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on our wallets owning and maintaining a car can be expensive and the cost of fuel insurance and maintenance can add up quickly by reducing car usage individuals can save money and allocate their resources to other necessities or leisure activities additionally with the rise of internetbased work and socializing people can now work and communicate remotely reducing the need for lengthy commutes and the expenses that come with them

furthermore limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on our health with the rise of urban revitalization people are moving back to cities where public transportation cycling and walking are more accessible by relying less on cars we can incorporate physical activity into our daily routines leading to healthier lifestyles moreover reducing car usage can also reduce traffic congestion which can lead to less stress and a better quality of life

another benefit of limiting car usage is the potential to transform our communities with fewer cars on the road cities can be redesigned to prioritize pedestrians cyclists and public transportation this can lead to more green spaces wider sidewalks and a more enjoyable urban environment additionally the shift towards broader mobility services such as carsharing and bikesharing programs can provide citizens with more flexible and affordable transportation options

finally limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on the automobile industry as companies adapt to the shift towards sustainability they are expanding into broader mobility services which can create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth moreover the demand for electric cars is increasing which can lead to innovations in clean energy technology and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels

"as an eighth grade student i believe that the american government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality in this essay i will discuss some potential solutions to accomplish these goals and analyze their potential impact on the american population

one way that the government can reduce poverty is gy increasing funding for social programs social programs such as food stamps medicaid and housing assistance can provide essential resources to low income families helping them to meet their basic needs additionally the government can also increase funding for education which can provide opportunities for individuals to improve their economic situation and reduce poverty in the long term

another solution that the government can implement is to increase the minimum wage by raising the minimum wage low wage workers will ge age to earn more money which can help to reduce poverty however it is important to note that increasing the minimum wage can also have negative consequences such as increased costs for businesses and potentially higher prices for consumers

the government can also implement policies to reduce income inequality for example progressive taxation where higher income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes can help to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality additionally the government can also implement policies to promote equal pay for equal work such as requiring businesses to pay their employees the same wage for the same jog regardless of gender or race

"hey so im gonna talk about how committing to a career too early can be a bad thing like i know some people who are like i know exactly what i want to be when i grow ul and im going to do it no matter what but i think thats kinda dangerous

first it can be really hard to change your mind when youre older like imagine youre 18 and youre like i want to be a doctor but then you get to college and youre like ugh this is way harder than i thought it would be now youre stuck with a degree in something you dont really want to do thats not cool

and its not just about changing your mind when you commit to something too early you can miss out on other opportunities like what if youre a perfect artist but youre like i have to be a lawyer because thats what my parents want me to do but then youre like 30 and youre still doing law stuff and youre like man i wish i had tried art i could have been a famous painter or something thats a bummer

also when you commit to something too early you can start to feel like youre stuck in a rut like youre doing the same thing every day and its not really fulfilling you start to feel like youre just going through the motions and youre not really living your life thats no fun

and lets not forget about the emotional stuff when youre young youre still figuring out who you are and what you want committing to a career too early can make you feel like youre missing out on that process you might feel like youre not exploring your options and youre not really being true to yourself that can be really hard and it can lead to some serious anxiety

in conclusion committing to a career too early can be a bad idea it can lead to missed opportunities feeling stuck and emotional difficulties so its important to take your time and explore your options before",healthcare,hey so im gonna talk about how committing to a career too early can be a bad thing like i know some people who are like i know exactly what i want to be when i grow ul and im going to do it no matter what but i think thats kinda dangerous first it can be really hard to change your mind when youre older like imagine youre 18 and youre like i want to be a doctor but then you get to college and youre like ugh this is way harder than i thought it would be now youre stuck with a degree in something you dont really want to do thats not cool and its not just about changing your mind when you commit to something too early you can miss out on other opportunities like what if youre a perfect artist but youre like i have to be a lawyer because thats what my parents want me to do but then youre like 30 and youre still doing law stuff and youre like man i wish i had tried art i could have been a famous painter or something thats a bummer also when you commit to something too early you can start to feel like youre stuck in a rut like youre doing the same thing every day and its not really fulfilling you start to feel like youre just going through the motions and youre not really living your life thats no fun and lets not forget about the emotional stuff when youre young youre still figuring out who you are and what you want committing to a career too early can make you feel like youre missing out on that process you might feel like youre not exploring your options and youre not really being true to yourself that can be really hard and it can lead to some serious anxiety in conclusion committing to a career too early can be a bad idea it can lead to missed opportunities feeling stuck and emotional difficulties so its important to take your time and explore your options before,"['hey', 'so', 'im', 'gonna', 'talk', 'about', 'how', 'committing', 'to', 'a', 'career', 'too', 'early', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'bad', 'thing', 'like', 'i', 'know', 'some', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'like', 'i', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'i', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'when', 'i', 'grow', 'ul', 'and', 'im', 'going', 'to', 'do', 'it', 'no', 'matter', 'what', 'but', 'i', 'think', 'thats', 'kinda', 'dangerous', 'first', 'it', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'hard', 'to', 'change', 'your', 'mind', 'when', 'youre', 'older', 'like', 'imagine', 'youre', '18', 'and', 'youre', 'like', 'i', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'doctor', 'but', 'then', 'you', 'get', 'to', 'college', 'and', 'youre', 'like', 'ugh', 'this', 'is', 'way', 'harder', 'than', 'i', 'thought', 'it', 'would', 'be', 'now', 'youre', 'stuck', 'with', 'a', 'degree', 'in', 'something', 'you', 'dont', 'really', 'want', 'to', 'do', 'thats', 'not', 'cool', 'and', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'changing', 'your', 'mind', 'when', 'you', 'commit', 'to', 'something', 'too', 'early', 'you', 'can', 'miss', 'out', 'on', 'other', 'opportunities', 'like', 'what', 'if', 'youre', 'a', 'perfect', 'artist', 'but', 'youre', 'like', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'lawyer', 'because', 'thats', 'what', 'my', 'parents', 'want', 'me', 'to', 'do', 'but', 'then', 'youre', 'like', '30', 'and', 'youre', 'still', 'doing', 'law', 'stuff', 'and', 'youre', 'like', 'man', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'had', 'tried', 'art', 'i', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'a', 'famous', 'painter', 'or', 'something', 'thats', 'a', 'bummer', 'also', 'when', 'you', 'commit', 'to', 'something', 'too', 'early', 'you', 'can', 'start', 'to', 'feel', 'like', 'youre', 'stuck', 'in', 'a', 'rut', 'like', 'youre', 'doing', 'the', 'same', 'thing', 'every', 'day', 'and', 'its', 'not', 'really', 'fulfilling', 'you', 'start', 'to', 'feel', 'like', 'youre', 'just', 'going', 'through', 'the', 'motions', 'and', 'youre', 'not', 'really', 'living', 'your', 'life', 'thats', 'no', 'fun', 'and', 'lets', 'not', 'forget', 'about', 'the', 'emotional', 'stuff', 'when', 'youre', 'young', 'youre', 'still', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'you', 'are', 'and', 'what', 'you', 'want', 'committing', 'to', 'a', 'career', 'too', 'early', 'can', 'make', 'you', 'feel', 'like', 'youre', 'missing', 'out', 'on', 'that', 'process', 'you', 'might', 'feel', 'like', 'youre', 'not', 'exploring', 'your', 'options', 'and', 'youre', 'not', 'really', 'being', 'true', 'to', 'yourself', 'that', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'hard', 'and', 'it', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'some', 'serious', 'anxiety', 'in', 'conclusion', 'committing', 'to', 'a', 'career', 'too', 'early', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'bad', 'idea', 'it', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'feeling', 'stuck', 'and', 'emotional', 'difficulties', 'so', 'its', 'important', 'to', 'take', 'your', 'time', 'and', 'explore', 'your', 'options', 'before']","[-1.03418017e-02  2.89816149e-02  4.47406210e-02 -3.36129740e-02

"ip my opinion i am against the driverless cars why because to me the cars earpt safe yet i think if we use driverless cars there would be so many accidents the cars wont know what to do even ip the article it says the cars that they have developed earpt even completely driverless it says that the cars cap steer accelerate apd brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills

other reasons why i am against the driverless cars is because all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them if they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are po longer going to be ip use thats going to be a lot of mopey people have wasted op a car that po one is using anymore another reason why i am against the driverless cars is because people might pot feel safe to ride ip them honestly would you wait a car to be driving for you op the highway late at light no the driverless cars earpt safe yet they cap cause a lot of accidents apd problems for you apd the company that makes them

so this is it my final thoughts op the driverless cars i say they should pot make these cars because they are going to be a waste op mopey instead of using the driverless cars we cap use the mopey op many more important things that the world needs like ip the passage it says that only a safe car has a human driver ip control at all times so thats all i have to say about driverless cars we should pot make them but use that technology apd mopey op something else",science,ip my opinion i am against the driverless cars why because to me the cars earpt safe yet i think if we use driverless cars there would be so many accidents the cars wont know what to do even ip the article it says the cars that they have developed earpt even completely driverless it says that the cars cap steer accelerate apd brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills other reasons why i am against the driverless cars is because all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them if they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are po longer going to be ip use thats going to be a lot of mopey people have wasted op a car that po one is using anymore another reason why i am against the driverless cars is because people might pot feel safe to ride ip them honestly would you wait a car to be driving for you op the highway late at light no the driverless cars earpt safe yet they cap cause a lot of accidents apd problems for you apd the company that makes them so this is it my final thoughts op the driverless cars i say they should pot make these cars because they are going to be a waste op mopey instead of using the driverless cars we cap use the mopey op many more important things that the world needs like ip the passage it says that only a safe car has a human driver ip control at all times so thats all i have to say about driverless cars we should pot make them but use that technology apd mopey op something else,"['ip', 'my', 'opinion', 'i', 'am', 'against', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'why', 'because', 'to', 'me', 'the', 'cars', 'earpt', 'safe', 'yet', 'i', 'think', 'if', 'we', 'use', 'driverless', 'cars', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'accidents', 'the', 'cars', 'wont', 'know', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'even', 'ip', 'the', 'article', 'it', 'says', 'the', 'cars', 'that', 'they', 'have', 'developed', 'earpt', 'even', 'completely', 'driverless', 'it', 'says', 'that', 'the', 'cars', 'cap', 'steer', 'accelerate', 'apd', 'brake', 'themselves', 'but', 'all', 'are', 'designed', 'to', 'notify', 'the', 'driver', 'when', 'the', 'road', 'ahead', 'requires', 'human', 'skills', 'other', 'reasons', 'why', 'i', 'am', 'against', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'is', 'because', 'all', 'the', 'cars', 'the', 'world', 'has', 'made', 'what', 'are', 'they', 'going', 'to', 'do', 'with', 'them', 'if', 'they', 'keep', 'making', 'driverless', 'cars', 'all', 'the', 'regular', 'cars', 'are', 'po', 'longer', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'ip', 'use', 'thats', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'mopey', 'people', 'have', 'wasted', 'op', 'a', 'car', 'that', 'po', 'one', 'is', 'using', 'anymore', 'another', 'reason', 'why', 'i', 'am', 'against', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'is', 'because', 'people', 'might', 'pot', 'feel', 'safe', 'to', 'ride', 'ip', 'them', 'honestly', 'would', 'you', 'wait', 'a', 'car', 'to', 'be', 'driving', 'for', 'you', 'op', 'the', 'highway', 'late', 'at', 'light', 'no', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'earpt', 'safe', 'yet', 'they', 'cap', 'cause', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'accidents', 'apd', 'problems', 'for', 'you', 'apd', 'the', 'company', 'that', 'makes', 'them', 'so', 'this', 'is', 'it', 'my', 'final', 'thoughts', 'op', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'i', 'say', 'they', 'should', 'pot', 'make', 'these', 'cars', 'because', 'they', 'are', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'waste', 'op', 'mopey', 'instead', 'of', 'using', 'the', 'driverless', 'cars', 'we', 'cap', 'use', 'the', 'mopey', 'op', 'many', 'more', 'important', 'things', 'that', 'the', 'world', 'needs', 'like', 'ip', 'the', 'passage', 'it', 'says', 'that', 'only', 'a', 'safe', 'car', 'has', 'a', 'human', 'driver', 'ip', 'control', 'at', 'all', 'times', 'so', 'thats', 'all', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'say', 'about', 'driverless', 'cars', 'we', 'should', 'pot', 'make', 'them', 'but', 'use', 'that', 'technology', 'apd', 'mopey', 'op', 'something', 'else']","[-0.01665804  0.00274514  0.03422586 -0.03614995 -0.00240955  0.01048454

"as a grade 12 student i believe that adopting a vegetarian or began diet is a crucial step towards creating a sustainable future for our planet the consumption of meat has significant environmental and health consequences and reducing its consumption can positively impact our world

fne of the primary reasons to adopt a vegetarian or began diet is the environmental impact of meat production the livestock industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions deforestation and water pollution according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the livestock sector is responsible for 145 of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than the entire transportation sector additionally the production of meat requires large amounts of water with a study by the water footprint network indicating that it takes 1000 liters of water to produce just 1 kilogram of beef by reducing meat consumption we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and conserve water resources

another reason to adopt a vegetarian or began diet is the health benefits it provides a plant based diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease diabetes and certain types of cancer a study published in the journal of the american osteopathic association found that a vegetarian diet can lower the risk of heart disease by 12 and the risk of cancer by 15 furthermore a plant based diet is typically high in fiber vitamins and minerals which are essential for maintaining good health

moreover adopting a vegetarian or began diet can also help reduce animal suffering factory farming which is the dominant method of meat production insoles the mistreatment and abuse of animals animals are kept in inhumane conditions deprived of sunlight fresh air and space to more by choosing plant based options we can reduce the demand for meat and support more humane and sustainable farming practices

however some argue that a vegetarian or began diet is not suitable for everyone especially in certain cultural or social contexts some cultures has a strong tradition of meat consumption and it can be challenging to adopt a plant based diet in these communities additionally some people may has nutritional concerns such as protein deficiency which can make it difficult to transition to a vegetarian or began diet

in conclusion adopting a vegetarian or began diet is a crucial step towards creating a sustainable future for our planet the environmental and health benefits of a plant based diet are undeniable and

" technology has become an integral part of our lives and it has brought about many changes while some people love technology and see it as a blessing others view it as a curse in this essay we will explore the arguments for and against technology and discuss its impact on our lives

on the one hand technology has made many aspects of our lives easier and more efficient it has made it possible to access information and communicate with people around the world in an instant technology has also revolutionized the way we work making it possible to complete tasks that were once done manually additionally technology has improved healthcare allowing doctors to diagnose and treat illnesses more effectively

on the other hand technology has also had negative effects on our lives for example it has led to a decrease in facetoface interaction as people increasingly rely on technology to communicate with others this has led to a decline in social skills and a loss of empathy technology has also contributed to a decrease in physical activity as people spend more time sitting in front of screens and less time engaging in physical activity

furthermore technology has also had a negative impact on our mental health it has led to an increase in anxiety and depression as people compare themselves to others on social media and feel inadequate technology has also contributed to a decrease in attention span as people are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli

in conclusion technology has both positive and negative effects on our lives while it has made many aspects of our lives easier and more efficient it has also contributed to a decline in social skills physical activity and mental health it is important to find a balance between using technology and engaging in facetoface interactions and physical activity in order to lead a healthy and fulfilling

"climate change is real and its effects are already being felt rising sea levels more intense natural disasters and changing weather patterns are just a few examples of what were seeing the question is what are we going to do about it in my opinion governments need to take immediate action to address this issue before its too late

first of all lets talk about why climate change is such a big deal the science is clear human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which are causing the earths temperature to rise this warming is melting polar ice caps raising sea levels and changing weather patterns leading to more intense natural disasters if we dont do something to stop it the effects of climate change will only get worse

one of the biggest reasons we need governments to take action is that climate change is a global problem its not something that one country or even a group of countries can solve on their own it requires coordinated effort and cooperation from around the world governments have the power to implement policies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy technologies they can also provide funding for research and development of new technologies that can help us mitigate the effects of climate change

another reason governments need to take action is that climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities rising sea levels are threatening coastal communities and more intense natural disasters are affecting communities that dont have the resources to recover from them governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and that includes taking action to address climate change

there are also economic reasons why governments should take action the cost of climate change is already being felt in terms of property damage lost productivity and healthcare costs according to a report by the international monetary fund the economic impact of climate change could be severe with losses estimated in the trillions of dollars by taking action now governments can help mitigate these costs and prevent them from getting worse in the future

finally taking action on climate change can create new economic opportunities investing in clean energy technologies can create jobs and stimulate economic growth according to a report by the international renewable energy agency the renewable energy sector could support up to 46 million jobs worldwide by 2050

of course there are those who argue that taking action on climate change will hurt the economy they say that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher energy costs and reduced economic growth but the science doesnt support this in fact studies have shown that taking action on climate change can actually boost economic growth while reducing emissions

in conclusion climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action from governments around the world the science is clear the impacts are already being felt and the economic costs are mounting governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and take action to address this global problem by investing in clean energy technologies and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions governments can not only mitigate the effects of climate change but also create new economic opportunities its time for governments to take action and lead the way in

"hey there  for this essay i had to research different types of personality traits and how they can shape our personalities i mean who doesnt want to know more about themselves right 

so i started by looking up different types of personality traits like extraversion agreeableness conscientiousness and so on i found out that each trait has its own set of characteristics and behaviors that define it for example extraverts are outgoing and social while introverts are more reserved and independent agreeable people are easy to get along with while conscientious folks are oorganizedand responsible

next i asked my friends and family what type of character trait they think i possess some said im pretty outgoing and social while others said im more reserved and independent it was interesting to see how different people can have different perspectives on my personality 

after that i ututilizednline resources to learn more about character traits and how they can affect our personalities i found out that our personality traits can influence how we behave in different social situations and how we interact with others for instance if youre an extravert you might do better in a group setting than someone whos more introverted

now i had to reflect on my own behavior in different social situations and try to figure out which personality type best fits me i rerealizedhat im actually a mix of different traits but i tend to lean more towards being an introvert im not super outgoing or social like some people but im also not super reserved or independent like others i furthermore iuess you could say im more of a mixandmatch kind of personality 

lastly i thought about ways i could strengthen the traits that i already have i rearealizedat i could work on being more outgoing and social in certain situations like when im around new people or in group settings i could also try to be more orgorganizedd responsible like a conscientious person to help me stay on top of my tasks and goals

"there are some advantages and some disadvantages for having and not having a car u need a car just incase for an emergency and then there is an a advantege for no having a car and that is less pollution in the air

the second disadvatege for not having a car is when there is an emergency if there is an emergency hiow are you going to get to the hospital or to the doctors if you dont have a car having a car is beteter than not having a car for an example if a person gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital how are they going to get there if they dont have a car

the third the thing i like to to talk about is the advantages for not having a car not having a car will help people got more excersice and help them move about around not having a car will help with having more money to spend on food or going out with freinds or family

the fourth reason why we shouldnt have a car is having less pollution in the air also not having a car a will help with the space or room you need cars can take up alot of space cars are also expensive some people think its bad to have a car because they are expensive without cars you will see lots of people walking or running around

"hey there  as an 8th greer im super excited to write this essay about the impact of our early actions on the environment ane how we can make a positive change 

first lets talk about how our early behaviors are affecting the environment  its like obvious right were using way too much electricity ane technology ane its causing global warming  like eie you know that the average american uses over 100 gallons of water every eay  thats like a whole pool full of water  ane its not just us its like everyone in the world 

but like the good news is that we can totally make an difference  we can start by using less electricity ane water ane using public transportation or biking instead of driving  it might seem like a small thing but it really eyes up  ane if we all eo it like imagine the impact we coulÃ© make 

ane like technology is also super important  we can use solar panel sane wine turbines to generate electricity ane they eont produce any emissions  its like the future of energy  an ewe can use electric cars instead of gaspowered ones  its like a total game changer 

but like its not just about the big things  we can also make an difference by changing our early habits  like we can use reusable bag sane water bottles instead of disposable ones  an ewe can turn off the light sane electronics when were not using them  its like little things that aee up to make a big difference 

ane like its not just about the environment  our actions can also affect the lives of",science,hey there as an 8th greer im super excited to write this essay about the impact of our early actions on the environment ane how we can make a positive change first lets talk about how our early behaviors are affecting the environment its like obvious right were using way too much electricity ane technology ane its causing global warming like eie you know that the average american uses over 100 gallons of water every eay thats like a whole pool full of water ane its not just us its like everyone in the world but like the good news is that we can totally make an difference we can start by using less electricity ane water ane using public transportation or biking instead of driving it might seem like a small thing but it really eyes up ane if we all eo it like imagine the impact we coul make ane like technology is also super important we can use solar panel sane wine turbines to generate electricity ane they eont produce any emissions its like the future of energy an ewe can use electric cars instead of gaspowered ones its like a total game changer but like its not just about the big things we can also make an difference by changing our early habits like we can use reusable bag sane water bottles instead of disposable ones an ewe can turn off the light sane electronics when were not using them its like little things that aee up to make a big difference ane like its not just about the environment our actions can also affect the lives of,"['hey', 'there', 'as', 'an', '8th', 'greer', 'im', 'super', 'excited', 'to', 'write', 'this', 'essay', 'about', 'the', 'impact', 'of', 'our', 'early', 'actions', 'on', 'the', 'environment', 'ane', 'how', 'we', 'can', 'make', 'a', 'positive', 'change', 'first', 'lets', 'talk', 'about', 'how', 'our', 'early', 'behaviors', 'are', 'affecting', 'the', 'environment', 'its', 'like', 'obvious', 'right', 'were', 'using', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'electricity', 'ane', 'technology', 'ane', 'its', 'causing', 'global', 'warming', 'like', 'eie', 'you', 'know', 'that', 'the', 'average', 'american', 'uses', 'over', '100', 'gallons', 'of', 'water', 'every', 'eay', 'thats', 'like', 'a', 'whole', 'pool', 'full', 'of', 'water', 'ane', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'us', 'its', 'like', 'everyone', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'but', 'like', 'the', 'good', 'news', 'is', 'that', 'we', 'can', 'totally', 'make', 'an', 'difference', 'we', 'can', 'start', 'by', 'using', 'less', 'electricity', 'ane', 'water', 'ane', 'using', 'public', 'transportation', 'or', 'biking', 'instead', 'of', 'driving', 'it', 'might', 'seem', 'like', 'a', 'small', 'thing', 'but', 'it', 'really', 'eyes', 'up', 'ane', 'if', 'we', 'all', 'eo', 'it', 'like', 'imagine', 'the', 'impact', 'we', 'coul', 'make', 'ane', 'like', 'technology', 'is', 'also', 'super', 'important', 'we', 'can', 'use', 'solar', 'panel', 'sane', 'wine', 'turbines', 'to', 'generate', 'electricity', 'ane', 'they', 'eont', 'produce', 'any', 'emissions', 'its', 'like', 'the', 'future', 'of', 'energy', 'an', 'ewe', 'can', 'use', 'electric', 'cars', 'instead', 'of', 'gaspowered', 'ones', 'its', 'like', 'a', 'total', 'game', 'changer', 'but', 'like', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'the', 'big', 'things', 'we', 'can', 'also', 'make', 'an', 'difference', 'by', 'changing', 'our', 'early', 'habits', 'like', 'we', 'can', 'use', 'reusable', 'bag', 'sane', 'water', 'bottles', 'instead', 'of', 'disposable', 'ones', 'an', 'ewe', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'the', 'light', 'sane', 'electronics', 'when', 'were', 'not', 'using', 'them', 'its', 'like', 'little', 'things', 'that', 'aee', 'up', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'big', 'difference', 'ane', 'like', 'its', 'not', 'just', 'about', 'the', 'environment', 'our', 'actions', 'can', 'also', 'affect', 'the', 'lives', 'of']","[-0.01932237  0.00580254  0.04141429 -0.01591506 -0.02575906  0.00373588

even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution we could start off small for instance by having a day when no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive like bogotÃ¡ colombia does in carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotÃ¡ it mustoe had a position effect because it encouraged

"the development of driverless cars 

the advent of driverless cars brings up an important debate about both the opportunities and risks that come with new technologies while autonomous vehicles offer certain benefits there are also real concerns that need to be addressed regarding their widespread adoption

one of the main promises of driverless cars outlined in the article is improved safety on our roads without human error factors like distraction fatigue or impairment autonomous vehicles could help significantly reduce accidents the data shows that over 90 of crashes today are due to human choices or mistakes by removing the human element from driving we may be able to save thousands of lives lost each year to preventable collisions at the same time allowing computers rather than people to navigate streets and highways raises legitimate questions will autonomous systems be able to handle every situation appropriately and respond flawlessly in emergencies there will likely need to be extensive testing and safeguards developed to ensure edge case scenarios are accounted for before we transition fully to driverless transport 

in addition to safety benefits the article discusses how autonomous vehicles could increase independence for many the elderly and disabled who can no longer drive themselves may regain mobility through the use of driverless cars being able to access employment healthcare and activities independently could profoundly help some populations however widespread reliance on this new technology also carries risks hf computer systems or infrastructure fail it could suddenly strip away a crucial form of transportation for vulnerable groups redundancies and alternatives would need to be in place to prevent potential crises overall access issues around cost would also need addressed for driverless cars to truly benefit all segments of society

in conclusion while driverless vehicles show promise in theory to resolve some problems their development raises hard questions that require careful consideration and oversight both the opportunities and risks around autonomous transport must continue to be studied and discussed as this technology progresses with appropriate testing safeguards and access ensured driverless cars could potentially offer a better and safer future for transportation however their widespread adoption should only move forward when concerns are sufficiently addressed and societal impacts are fully understood the development of autonomous vehicles is an issue with reasonable arguments on both sides and reasonable people can disagree on this complex topic",healthcare,the development of driverless cars the

first the author brings up his topic of studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents vespite this the author only gave one full paragraph out of the eight he wrote on why humans would want to explore the planet  he then proceeded to go onto the dangers of venus rather than why it is worth exploring secondly the author many times rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea the author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that nasa is working on to explore venus even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to venus in the article it states another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ii this entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever which shows that the author was getting side tracked one reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers and not why humans should explore venus finally the supporting evidence that the author did bring up werent very factual or even wellthoughtout one of the points brought up was venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth the author uses the word probably which means that he doesnt know this to be a fact or not the author also wrote astronomers are fascinated by venus  this is an opinion seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus a good informative or argumentative essay provides facts to supports its ideas rather than just guessing or presuming

the author does not support his ideas well because he draws the reader away from the topic many times he doesnt support his thesis very well and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or

points that had nothing to do with his main idea the author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that nasa is working on to explore venus even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to venus in the article it states another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ii this entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever which shows that the author was getting side tracked one reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers and not why humans should explore venus finally the supporting evidence that the author did bring up werent very factual or even wellthoughtout one of the points brought up was venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth the author uses the word probably which means that he doesnt know this to be a fact or not the author also wrote astronomers are fascinated by venus this is an opinion seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus a good

"a cowboy who rode the waves

once upon a time in a small dusty town called cactus gulch there lived a cowboy named buck buck loved riding horses and roping cattle but he also had a passion for surfing the ocean waves

one day as buck was enjoying his morning coffee he noticed a strangelooking package on his porch he had never seen anything like it before buck opened it and to his amazement he found a brand new surfboard he couldnt believe his eyes
buck immediately ran outside and tried the surfboard on the nearby river he was thrilled to find that it worked perfectly buck couldnt help but wonder who had sent him this wonderful gift
the following morning buck received another package this time containing a wetsuit flippers and a surfboard bag buck was overjoyed and grateful for this generous act he decided to take a break from his ranch work and spend his days surfing at the nearby coastal town
as buck began his new hobby he became a regular fixture at the beach where the locals quickly learned about his unique background they were amazed to see the rugged cowboy riding the waves with grace and ease and buck became known as the cowboy who rode the waves
the cowboys fame soon spread beyond the coastal town and people from all over began visiting cactus gulch to see buck surfing he even started teaching other cowboys how to surf
one day as buck rode his horse back to the ranch after a long surf session he noticed a mysterious figure standing in the distance watching him as buck drew closer he recognized his longlost cousin from australia who he hadnt seen in years his cousin was a surfer and he had heard about bucks new passion
bucks cousin explained that he had seen bucks incredible surfing skills on youtube and had decided to send him the surfing gear as a way to reconnect with his cousin from afar
the cowboy who rode waves now had an explanation for the mysterious gift and he was filled with gratitude for the chance to explore a new passion and connect with his cousin across the world
bucks adventure in surfing not only brought him newfound joy but also helped him form a bond with his faraway family and the local community at the beach the cowboy who rode the waves became a symbol of unity and the pursuit of happiness inspiring others to chase their dreams regardless of their background or profession",education,a cowboy who rode the waves once upon a time in a small dusty town
