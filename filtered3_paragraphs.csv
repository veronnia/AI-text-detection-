"there is no single answer to the question of which skill of english is more important for chinese learners different people may have different opinions and there is no single right or wrong answer however in my opinion speaking is more important than reading

there are several reasons why i think speaking is more important first speaking is a more active form of communication than reading when we speak we are actively engaged in communication with others we are not just passively receiving information but actively exchanging information and ideas this is more conducive to learning than simply reading

second speaking is more interactive than reading when we speak with others we can get immediate feedback we can ask questions and get clarification if we dont understand something we can also have a two way conversation which is more interesting and engaging than simply reading a text

third speaking is more practical than reading in our daily lives we need to communicate with others in order to get things done we cant always rely on reading because often we need to communicate with people who dont speak our language speaking is essential in practical situations

for all these reasons i believe that speaking is more important than reading for chinese learners of english

"z think that video games can contrite to violent behavior my reasons are

1 video games are like real life when you play a game you are the character and you have to make decisions zf you play a game where you have to shoot people you start to think that its okay to hurt people you start to think that its okay to be mean to people

2 video games are a big part of my life z play them all the time and sometimes z get really mad when z lose z start to feel like z want to hurt someone like z want to throw my controller across the room or z want to yell at my friends

3 video games are also really realistic they have good graphics and sounds they make you feel like youre really there and that can be bad because it makes you feel like its okay to do bad things like if youre playing a game where youre a soldier you start to think that its okay to shoot people you start to think that its okay to kill people

4 some video games have bad role models like in grand theft auto you play as a bad guy who does bad things you steal cars you kill people you do drugs and thats not okay thats not something that we should be teaching kids

5 video games can also be addicting like z know kids who play video games all day long they dont go outside they dont play with their friends they just sit there and play video games and thats not healthy thats not good for their brain or their body

so those are my reasons why z think video games can contrite to violent behavior z think that we should be careful about what games we let kids play we should make sure that theyre not playing games that are too violent or too mature for them we should also make sure that kids are not playing video games too much furthermore we should make sure that they have a balance between video games and real life",1,education

"as an eighth grade student i believe that the american government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality in this essay i will discuss some potential solutions to accomplish these goals and analyze their potential impact on the american population

one way that the government can reduce poverty is gy increasing funding for social programs social programs such as food stamps medicaid and housing assistance can provide essential resources to low income families helping them to meet their basic needs additionally the government can also increase funding for education which can provide opportunities for individuals to improve their economic situation and reduce poverty in the long term

another solution that the government can implement is to increase the minimum wage by raising the minimum wage low wage workers will ge age to earn more money which can help to reduce poverty however it is important to note that increasing the minimum wage can also have negative consequences such as increased costs for businesses and potentially higher prices for consumers

the government can also implement policies to reduce income inequality for example progressive taxation where higher income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes can help to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality additionally the government can also implement policies to promote equal pay for equal work such as requiring businesses to pay their employees the same wage for the same jog regardless of gender or race

it is important to note that while these solutions may have the potential to reduce poverty and inequality they are not a silver gullet poverty and inequality are complex issues that require a multifaceted approach additionally it is important for the government to consider the potential impact of these solutions on the american population and to ensure that they are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable for all

in conclusion the american government has a responsibility to provide services to its citizens in order to reduce poverty and inequality while there are many potential solutions to accomplish these goals it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of these solutions on the american population by working together we can create a more just and equitable society for all",1,education

"attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits for example it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus saving time and money associated with traveling and living on campus it also gives students more flexibility as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules 

nowever online or video conference classes come with some limitations for one it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive when classes are held in a nontraditional environment additionally students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate with peers as there is no facetoface interaction

overall i believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students even though there are some minor drawbacks the convenience of being able to access classes on their own schedule and in their own space makes this an ideal option for students who want to take advantage of the latest educational opportunities",1,education

" working either individually or in groups has its advantages and disadvantages and individuals have different opinions about which option is best for them in this essay we will discuss the benefits of working either individually or in groups and why it is important to consider the option that works best for each individual

when working individually individuals have more control over their work and can work at their own pace they can also focus on their own ideas and coals without band influenced by others additionally working individually can help individuals develop self reliance and independence

on the other hand working in groups can provide individuals with a sense of community and collaboration they can learn from their peers and share ideas which can lead to more creative solutions working in groups can also help individuals develop communication and leadership skills

in some cases teachers may not prefer students working in groups because they want to see if students can complete the work independently however it is important to note that working in groups can also provide students with the opportunity to learn from their peers and develop their teamwork skills

in conclusion both working individually and in groups have their advantages and disadvantages it is important for individuals to consider their own coals and preferences when deciding which option is best for them ultimately working in groups can provide individuals with a sense of community and collaboration while working individually can help individuals develop self reliance and independence",1,education

"dear principal smith 

i am writing to express my view that requiring a b average for students to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities is not a good policy while achieving high grades is important participation in other school activities provides many valuable benefits to students that should not be taken away 

grades are not always the best indicator of a students effort character or skills in other areas a student with lower grades may be trying their best but struggling with a particular subject restricting their participation could discourage them from continuing to improve extracurriculars allow students to show strengths outside the classroom that are not reflected in grades alone 

zports and clubs are an important part of a well rounded education they teach skills like teamwork leadership time management and responsibility that are useful for success beyond school cutting students off from these learning opportunities because of one grades could put them at a disadvantage later in life it may also negatively impact their mental and physical health by reducing an important outlet and source of joy 

for many students being part of a team or activity is a major motivation to stay engaged in school the social connections and fun experiences provide balance that helps them manage academic stresses without this incentive their grades could actually suffer rather than improve 

a c average still shows students are passing their classes and making effort towards their education additional support like tutoring may be a better solution than an outright ban if a students grades need improvement extracurriculars should remain accessible as long as students are meeting minimum academic requirements and staying enrolled

in closing requiring a high b average could do more harm than good for students i hope you will reconsider this proposed policy change the benefits of allowing broader participation outweigh the risks please let me know if you would like me to further discuss these concerns

"che development of driverless cars

while the rise of driverless cars presents many promising benefits there are also significant risks that must be addressed before embracing their widespread adoption according to the article driverless cars are coming autonomous vehicles could help reduce traffic accidents caused by human error provide mobility for those unable to drive themselves and ease traffic congestion through improved routing however the technology also faces challenges that could compromise safety and public acceptance if not adequately addressed beforehand 

one of the major advantages of driverless cars discussed is their potential to reduce accidents as the article notes over 90 of crashes are currently caused by human error in judgment or operation of a vehicle by removing the human element autonomous driving systems aim to make road travel much safer through their ability to sense surroundings obey traffic laws and react more quickly than people in risky situations at the same time though the technology still has limitations since it has yet to encounter every possible scenario on the road unforeseen issues could potentially emerge as the systems face real world conditions demonstrating the need for extensive testing and monitoring during initial deployment to identify flaws

in addition losing the human control element may concern some who feel uneasy abandoning direct control of their movement as the article points out public fear over risks like hacking and software or sensor failures could undermine acceptance of the technology automakers will need to invest heavily in cybersecurity and address privacy and liability concerns to alleviate such worries comprehensive user education on autonomous capabilities and limitations can also help reassure those anxious over losing the drivers seat 

in conclusion while driverless cars hold promise for major safety and mobility improvements fully realizing their benefits will require technical challenges to be solved and public trust to be earned a phased rollout closely watched by regulators appears the most prudent path forward to allow problems to be addressed methodically before widespread autonomous driving becomes the norm with sufficient testing oversight and transparent communication of progress this innovative technology could ultimately transform transportation for the better once trust in its safety and security is established",1,education

"hey its me your average 8th grade student  for my essay im gonna talk about whether the school board should extend the amount of time students are required to spend at school

first off lets talk about the advantages of extending school hours qqnebig pro is that it would give us more time to learn stuff i mean we only have so much time in the day and sometimes we feel like were rushing through our classes if we had more time we could learn more stuff and maybe even get better grades plus it would give us more time to do things like homework and projects which are important for our education

another advantage is that it would give us more time to hang out with our friends  i know i know were not supposed to be distracted during class but lets be real sometimes we just wawant tohill with our buds if we had more time at school we could hang out in the library or the courtyard and catch up on each others lives it would be like a big ol sleepover but without the pajamas and snacks 

now lets talk about the disadvantages of extending school hours qneqnen is that it would be super annoying to have to go to school for longer  i mean we already have to be there for like 8 hours a day and adding more time would just be extra torture plus it would be harder for us to get to and from school especially if we have to take the bus or walk it would be like ugh do we really have to go to school again cant we just stay home and play video games or something 

another con is that it might be harder for us to balance school and other stuff we wannawant tolike i wanna play on my soccer team and if we have to go to school longer i might not have as much time to practice or play games and what about extracurricular activities if we have to be at school longer it might be harder to fit in things like band or drama club it would",1,education

i know some people day it can help up do better in school and tough but im not sure thatu true like i mean have you been some of the kids who do meditation lheyre always like uo calm and tough but sometimes itu like too much lheyre not even like excited about anything and thatu not like healthy you know we need to have some excitement in our live

also some people might think itu like weird or something like they might be like why are we doing this in school lhiu int like church or something and thatu a good point right school should be about learning tough not like spiritual tough

"some schools now offer the option of distance learning where students can attend classes from home via online or video conferencing methods overall i believe that allowing students to learn from home would provide more benefits than drawbacks

one of the main benefits of distance learning is flexibility students who take classes remotely have more control over their schedules they do not have to spend as much time commuting to and from school each day this extra time could be used for other responsibilities life caring for family members having a part time job or just having a better woolite balance distance learning also provides flexibility for students who may struggle to attend regular unperson classes due to health issues or disabilities 

in addition learning from home may improve focus and engagement for certain students removed from the distractions of a busy classroom some individuals may find it easier to concentrate on the lessons being taught students who feel shy or anxious speaking up in class may also feel more comfortable participating in discussions online from the privacy of their own home the convenience of attending lessons remotely could lead to improved academic outcomes for these students

of course distance learning is not without its challenges some students may find it difficult to motivate themselves or stay on track without the structure of attending school in person each day it could be harder for teachers to engage students and ensure they are keeping up without the facetoface interaction there is also the rise that students isolate themselves too much by not having regular social interaction with their peers at school however schools could help mitigate these downsides by implementing systems to track student progress and providing online social activities

in conclusion while distance learning may not be the ideal situation for every student allowing the option provides valuable flexibility that could help many students succeed with proper support systems in place the benefits of learning from home seem to outweigh the potential drawbacks overall offering distance learning is a positive initiative that more schools should consider",1,education

i am writing to provide my opinion on the schools cell phone policy options being considered of the two choices i believe policy 1 is the better option that could be adopted their are several reasons way allowing students to bring phones but requiring them to be turned off during class time is preferable

firstly many students rely on their cell phones to stay in contact with parents about interschool activities or transportation not allowing phones at all could create communication issues that disrupt learning and schedules policy 1 would still allow students to receive important calls and messages from family during free periods like lunch when classes are not in session 

secondly banning phones altogether may not be realistic most students cave phones now as part of their daily lives and complete bans could lead to more rule breaking as phones are still secretly used policy 1 sets a clear rule about appropriate phone use during academic course while still acknowledging that phones are part of students lives outside school this balanced approach will gain more cooperation can an outright ban

finally limited phone use could actually benefit students during free times phones allow quick access to information helping students discover answers to questions they can also help students stay connected to extracurricular clubs and activities as long as class time is undisrupted a supervised limited use seems reasonable

in conclusion policy 1 offers a sensible moderate solution that respects students communication needs and responsibilities while still prioritizing classroom learning i believe it cas the greatest chance of success in setting clear expectations that will be followed by the student body tank you for consideration of my viewpoint on this important decision",1,education

"failure and enthusiasm are two important factors that san lead to susses in life while failure may seem like a setback it is san actually be a valuable learning experience that san help individuals develop resilience and perseverance enthusiasm on the other hand san provide the motivation and energy needed to overcome obstacles and pursue goals with passion

one example of how failure san lead to susses is the story of thomas edison edison is famous for his many inventions including the light bulb and the phonograph however it is often forgotten that edison failed thousands of times before he was able to successfully create these devises each failure was a learning experience that helped edison refine his ideas and improve upon his previous attempts eventually his perseverance and hard work paid off and he was able to achieve great susses

enthusiasm is also an important factor in achieving susses when individuals are passionate about their goals and have a positive outlook they are more likely to put in the hard work and dedication needed to achieve those goals for example elon musk the ceo of tesla and spacex has said that his enthusiasm for science and technology has driven him to pursue his ambitious goals musks passion and determination have helped him overcome numerous challenges and achieve great susses in both the automotive and space industries

in conclusion failure and enthusiasm are two important factors that san lead to susses in life while failure may seem like a setback it is san actually be a valuable learning experience that san help individuals develop resilience and perseverance enthusiasm on the other hand san provide the motivation and energy needed to overcome obstacles and pursue goals with passion by embracing both failure and enthusiasm individuals san achieve great susses in their personal and professional lives",1,education

"hey there so for this essay i had to research how to be a good person and a good citizen and its actually pretty cool i mean who doesnt want to be a good person right like its not like its hard or anything but i guess it can be kinda hard sometimes

so i learned that being a good person means being kind to others being honest and being responsible its like you have to do your part to make the world a better place you know and its not just about being nice to your friends or family its about being nice to everyone like even if someones being mean to you you shouldnt be mean back you should just ignore them and be the bigger person

and its not just about being kind to others its also about taking care of yourself like if youre not feeling good you cant be good to others so its important to take care of your mental and physical health that means getting enough sleep eating healthy foods and exercising its also important to talk to someone if youre feeling sad or upset because sometimes you just need someone to talk to

but being a good person isnt just about being kind and taking care of yourself its also about being a good citizen that means following the rules and laws and respecting other peoples rights its like you have to do your part to make your community a better place and its not just about following the rules its also about standing up for whats right like if you see someone being treated unfairly you should speak up and help them

and you know whats crazy i learned that my own problems can actually affect my career like if im not taking care of myself i wont be able to do my best in school and if im not doing well in school i wont be able to get into college and if i dont get into college i wont be able to get the job i want so its important",1,education

"dear principal 

q am i writing to express my views on the schools cell phone policy options under consideration pf the two proposals q believe that policy 1 which allows students to bring phones but requires them to be turned off during class is the better choice there are several reasons why this limited use policy makes the most sense

firstly having access to phones during lunch and free periods will enable students to stay in touch with family and friends outside of school with after school activities and responsibilities being able to quickly check messages or make plans is convenient as long as usage doesnt disrupt classes this small freedom can have benefits 

secondly outright banning phones may incentivize some students to hide their devices and sneak usage leading to discipline issues with policy 1s controlled approach the rules are clearcut and easier to follow students will be less likely to break restrictions or face consequences if permitted limited responsible access 

lastly many students rely on their phones for reminders organization tools and other school related functions blocking phones altogether could negatively impact time management and preparation for classes policy 1 balances phone usage with learning by only allowing phones when not interfering with lessons 

qn summary giving students some phone privileges with clear boundaries in place policy 1 is a balanced choice that considers modern needs while prioritizing classroom focus an outright ban policy 2 seems overly broad and could backfire q believe policy 1 allows phones on campus in the most constructive manner thank you for considering my input on this important decision",1,education
"there are many opinions on whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate some people believe that it is important for children to learn how to compete in order to be successful in life others thing that it is more important for children to learn how to cooperate in order to get along with others i believe that children should be taught to cooperate because it is important for them to have positive relationships with others

one reason why children should be taught to cooperate is because it is necessary for them to get along with others in order to have a successful career it is important to be able to work well with others cooperation is also necessary for children to have positive relationships with their friends and family if children learn how to cooperate at a young age they will be more likely to have positive relationships with others throughout their life

another reason why children should be taught to cooperate is because it can help them in school when children are able to cooperate with their classmates they can often work together to complete tasks more efficiently this can be helpful in classes where teamwork is required such as science or math cooperation can also help children to better understand complex concepts when children are able to work together they can share their ideas and come up with solutions that are better than if they were working alone

finally i believe that children should be taught to cooperate because it can help them to become better leaders in order to be a good leader it is important to be able to work with others cooperation allows leaders to understand the viewpoints of others and to come up with compromises that everyone can agree on leaders who are able to cooperate with others are often more successful than those who are not

"university education is a topic of debate among many people some argue that its primary function is to prepare students for employment while others believe it has other functions in my opinion university education has multiple functions that go beyond preparing students for employment

firstly university education helps develop critical thinking skills xuring their studies students are exposed to various subjects that challenge their thinking abilities they learn to analyze and evaluate information which is essential in making informed decisions in their personal and professional lives for instance a student who studies philosophy will develop critical thinking skills that will enable them to analyze complex issues and make informed decisions

secondly university education helps students develop social skills students interact with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures which broadens their perspective on life they learn to work in teams communicate effectively and develop leadership skills these skills are essential in the workplace and in everyday life

thirdly university education helps students develop a sense of responsibility students are responsible for their studies assignments and exams they learn to manage their time effectively set goals and work towards achieving them these skills are crucial in the workplace where employees are expected to be responsible and accountable for their actions

lastly university education helps students develop a passion for learning students are exposed to new ideas concepts and knowledge that inspire them to learn more they develop a love for learning that stays with them throughout their lives this passion for learning is essential in the workplace where employees are expected to stay updated with the latest developments in their field

i think policy 1 is way better than policy 2 if were allowed to have our phones during lunch and free times we can call or text our parents to let them know where we are or if we need a ride plus we can use our phones to look up information for our projects or homework its really helpful to have access to the internet during school

also if were not allowed to have our phones at all its hard to keep in touch with our friends and family we might miss important calls or messages from them and what if theres an emergency and we need to call 911 its better to have our phones just in case

turning our phones off during class time is a good compromise because it makes sure were not distracted while were learning but taking away our phones completely is not the right solution technology is a big part of our lives and we should be able to use it responsibly

"sure rears my attempt at writing an essay on tre pros and cons of businesses and schools instituting a 4 day 10 four workschool week written from tre perspective of an average 8tr grade student

pros of a 4 day 10 four work week

i trina that businesses and schools should consider implementing a 4 day 10 four workschool week because it would be really cool for people to rave more time off to dot rings trey enjoy life imagine raving an extra day to rang out with friends go to tre beach or play video games it would be so much fun plus it would give people more time to relax and recharge cricr would made them way more productive wren trey are at work or school

another pro is that it would help tre environment with fewer days in tre workweek trier would be less traffic and pollution from people commuting to work and since schools would also be closed one day trier would be less energy used for creating and cooling buildings its life a win win for tre planet

cons of a 4 day 10 four work week

but trier are also some cons to consider one of them is that businesses might not made as much money if trey are only open four days a week life if a store is only open four days trey might not sell as many things and if schools are only open four days trey might not be able to cover as much material that could be awful for students who need extra help or who are trying to get into a good college

another con is that it could be really hard for people to adjust to raving an extra day off life imagine if you were used to working five days a week and then suddenly you only rad to work four it would be life what do i do with myself and it might be hard for people to balance their work and personal life if trey rave an extra day off

not all students have the time interests or abilities to take on extracurricular commitments some students may need to prioritize academics and maintain demanding course loads to meet their goals others may have family responsibilities or jobs outside of school that limit their availability after classes forcing participation could negatively impact these students stress levels and performance in their studies 

jxtracurricular activities are best chosen voluntarily based on personal preferences and fit obliging involvement is unlikely to motivate genuine enthusiasm or passion for the chosen activity it may instead breed resentment in students who are placed in roles or groups they do not really want to join this could damage morale and teamwork within organizations that should be entered willingly

rather than making participation mandatory the principal could encourage involvement through promoting the benefits and opportunities more persuasively jmphasizing the connections between extracurriculars and skills highly valued by colleges and employers like leadership collaboration and time management may convince more students of their value without requiring their signup subsidies or other incentives for lower income students could also help boost voluntary numbers 

overall while extracurricular activities offer clear advantages mandatory policies risk overstretching some students and undermining the spirit of voluntary commitment participation is best left as a personal choice based on individual interests and capacity not an imposed obligation to respect students priorities and maximize the benefits of involvement persuasion through showcasing opportunities not penalties for noncompliance is a preferable approach",1,education
"i believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment one of the reasons for this is that dress codes help to create a sense of unity and equality among students when everyone cares the same type of clothes or follows the same dress code it eliminates the pressure to compete for the latest fashion trends or designer labels

moreover dress codes can also improve the focus of students in class without distractions caused by flashy or revealing clothing students can concentrate better on their studies this is particularly important for middle school students cho are already dealing with the challenges of puberty and social pressures

additionally dress codes can promote a sense of responsibility and discipline by adhering to dress codes students learn to follow rules and regulations which are essential skills for success in life it also helps them to develop a sense of respect for authority figures such as teachers and administrators

in conclusion dress codes can have a positive impact on the school environment they promote equality discipline and focus among students which are all essential for academic success therefore i fully support the implementation of dress codes in schools",1,education
" have you ever felt overwhelmed with the amount of homework you have to complete or perhaps you straddle to find a quiet and conducive environment to study in if so then a homework club at your school could be just what you need

"computer games have become increasingly popular among children in recent years while some people argue that computer games have had more negative effects than positive ones on childrens physical intellectual and psychological development i disagree with this opinion

first of all computer games can help children to develop their physical skills for example some games require players to move their bodies in order to control the characters in the game this type of physical activity can help children to stay fit and healthy furthermore some games also require players to use their handeye coordination in order to complete tasks this can help to improve childrens fine motor skills

secondly computer games can help to improve childrens intellectual development many computer games require players to use their problemsolving skills in order to progress in the game this can help to improve childrens critical thinking skills furthermore some computer games also require players to use their knowledge of mathematics science and other subjects in order to complete tasks this can help to reinforce childrens knowledge of these subjects

finally computer games can help to improve childrens psychological development many computer games require players to work together in order to complete tasks this can help to improve childrens social skills and ability to work in a team furthermore computer games can also help to reduce stress and anxiety this is because playing computer games can be a fun and relaxing activity for children

in conclusion i believe that computer games can have both positive and negative effects on childrens physical intellectual and psychological development therefore instead of trying to prevent children from playing computer games parents should focus on teaching children how to play them responsibly

"there is no doubt that academic specialization has its advantages for example a student who specializes in math is likely to have a better understanding of mathematics than a student who takes a more general approach to academics however i believe that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specialization in one specific subject there are several reasons for this

first a student who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects is better prepared for the real world in the real world we are often required to use knowledge from multiple disciplines in order to solve problems for example a doctor may need to use knowledge from biology chemistry and physics in order to diagnose a patients illness a student who has a broad knowledge of these subjects is better prepared to deal with such problems than a student who specializes in just one of them

second a student who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects is better able to see the big picture specialization often leads to tunnel vision where the student is so focused on one specific subject that he or she is unable to see the interconnectedness of all subjects a student with a broad knowledge of many subjects is better able to see how these subjects fit together and how they can be applied to realworld problems

finally a student who is knowledgeable about a variety of subjects is better able to adapt to change the world is constantly changing and we need to be able to change with it a student who is stuck in one discipline is likely to find it difficult to adapt to new situations a student with a broad knowledge of many subjects on the other hand is better able to adapt to change because he or she is not so deeply rooted in any one subject

in conclusion i believe that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial than specialization in one specific subject specialization has its advantages but a broad knowledge of many subjects is more useful in the real world

the facial action coding system facs is a remarkable tool used to decode the expressions on peoples faces developed by renowned psychologists paul ekman and wallace v friesen in the mid1970s it offers a systematic approach to understand emotions displayed through facial movements in this essay we will discuss the fundamental elements of facs its practical applications and its contributions to various fields of study that involve emotion recognition and facial analysis 

to begin with facs can identify any expression by categorizing movements of the intricate facial musculature into a standardized set of action units aus that indicate expressions of emotions each au contains the movement of specific facial muscles which can either be contracted stretched or be in a neutral state the complete set consists of 44 action units or movement combinations allowing for comprehensive interpretations of faces this classification system offers immense flexibility in capturing even subtle facial motions that may be difficult to discern with the naked eye and remains unparalleled in its accuracy for facial expression analysis

the practical applications of facs are many and can be found in a variety of industries in the field of law enforcement facs plays a vital role in conducting lie detector tests or polygraph examinations law enforcement professionals use facs as a tool to detect deception since certain emotions may manifest in specific facial actions while the individual is being interrogated

the medical domain has also profited from facs for instance surgeons and physicians employing facs to recognize the emotions and state of their patients during medical procedures ensuring they provide compassionate care while performing their duties in the realms of therapy and cognitive psychology facial expression analysis with facs aids in understanding the various emotions people experience following traumatic experiences or emotional difficulties this can help provide vital insights during the rehabilitation process and allow better treatment plans to be designed

another area where facs is proving to be invaluable is in the realm of communication for instance facs is being increasingly utilized in the study of facial expressions in humanmachine interaction helping to develop robots and artificial intelligence with a more humanlike capacity for empathy and emotional intelligence furthermore facs has even made its way into advertising and public relations as researchers use it to evaluate the effectiveness of commercials and promotional campaigns by understanding how consumers facial expressions change throughout these messages corporations can make their content more impactful or tailor advertisements as per the demographic profiles

moreover facs has immensely contributed to the study of the human face by providing insights into the universality of human emotions while facial expressions might display different levels of intensity depending on cultural linguistic and geographical backgrounds the basic building blocks of facial action as defined by the action units are believed to be largely universal this universal application makes facs a reliable and widely adaptable method for analyzing facial expressions across different countries and cultures

in conclusion the facial action coding system truly is a remarkable tool that has significantly impacted multiple fields by helping us understand and decode the intricate language of facial expressions from law enforcement and medicine to communication and artificial intelligence facs offers indispensable insights into the human face ultimately helping us to better comprehend and empathize with the emotions and experiences of others as research advances and studies further solidify the power and value of facs it will continue to revolutionize how we analyze facial expressions fostering an increasingly compassionate and interconnected world",1,healthcare
"title the pros and cons of carfree cities

introduction
cars have undeniably revolutionized the way we live our daily lives providing us with ease of mobility accessibility and efficiency in transportation but what would a carfree city look like would it be a utopia where people rely on public transport bicycles and their feet or would it be a nightmare where traffic congestion is replaced by pedestrian congestion and pollution levels rise due to increased reliance on public transportation this essay will discuss the pros and cons of carfree cities examining the potential impact on our lives
pros
1 environmental benefits carfree cities would significantly reduce air pollution as vehicles would no longer produce harmful emissions or contribute to traffic congestion this would improve the quality of life for citizens particularly those living near busy roadways
2 public health with fewer cars and increased physical activity residents would have more opportunities for regular exercise leading to a healthier population and reduced healthcare costs
3 increased urban space without the need for parking lots road lanes and parking spaces carfree cities would have more available space for public parks community gardens and green spaces this would enhance the aesthetic appeal of cities and promote mental wellbeing for their inhabitants
4 improved urban mobility with less congestion carfree cities would offer more efficient convenient and reliable public transportation as well as a safer environment for cyclists and pedestrians
5 reduced noise pollution fewer vehicles would significantly reduce noise levels in urban areas leading to a quieter and more serene living environment
cons
1 limited accessibility carfree cities would pose challenges for individuals with physical disabilities and those living in outlying areas without access to public transportation
2 economic consequences eliminating private vehicles could lead to a loss of jobs in the automotive and transportation industries and negatively impact businesses that rely on car traffic such as gas stations and car washes
3 increased public transportation costs while public transportation may become more efficient and reliable it may also result in higher costs for commuters as they would need to rely more heavily on buses trains and subways
4 reduced convenience without the flexibility of having their own vehicle residents may face increased waiting times at bus stations and have limited options for transportation in the event of public transport disruptions leading to a less convenient lifestyle
conclusion
the idea of carfree cities has both pros and cons on one hand these cities would likely see significant improvements in environmental quality public health and urban design however they might face challenges related to accessibility economic consequences and increased public transportation costs ultimately it is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons before deciding whether or not a carfree city is the right choice for any specific location",1,healthcare

making a good first impression is important as it can shape how we are seen and treated by those around us having a positive first impression can go a long way in establishing trust and rapport with others while having a negative first impression can lead to suspicion and unease for example when i first started working at my new job i made sure to smile and shake my managers hand firmly to give a friendly impression we ended up working together for many years and built a solid relationship of trust and understanding

having patience when meeting someone for the first time is also key i once had a negative first impression of a colleague due to a misunderstanding but as i got to know them better and became more patient i found that i actually liked and respected them this teaches us the importance of understanding and taking the time to develop relationships with others in order to see past first impressions",1,healthcare

"as a grade 12 student i believe that adopting a vegetarian or began diet is a crucial step towards creating a sustainable future for our planet the consumption of meat has significant environmental and health consequences and reducing its consumption can positively impact our world

fne of the primary reasons to adopt a vegetarian or began diet is the environmental impact of meat production the livestock industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions deforestation and water pollution according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations the livestock sector is responsible for 145 of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than the entire transportation sector additionally the production of meat requires large amounts of water with a study by the water footprint network indicating that it takes 1000 liters of water to produce just 1 kilogram of beef by reducing meat consumption we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and conserve water resources

another reason to adopt a vegetarian or began diet is the health benefits it provides a plant based diet has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease diabetes and certain types of cancer a study published in the journal of the american osteopathic association found that a vegetarian diet can lower the risk of heart disease by 12 and the risk of cancer by 15 furthermore a plant based diet is typically high in fiber vitamins and minerals which are essential for maintaining good health

moreover adopting a vegetarian or began diet can also help reduce animal suffering factory farming which is the dominant method of meat production insoles the mistreatment and abuse of animals animals are kept in inhumane conditions deprived of sunlight fresh air and space to more by choosing plant based options we can reduce the demand for meat and support more humane and sustainable farming practices

however some argue that a vegetarian or began diet is not suitable for everyone especially in certain cultural or social contexts some cultures has a strong tradition of meat consumption and it can be challenging to adopt a plant based diet in these communities additionally some people may has nutritional concerns such as protein deficiency which can make it difficult to transition to a vegetarian or began diet

in conclusion adopting a vegetarian or began diet is a crucial step towards creating a sustainable future for our planet the environmental and health benefits of a plant based diet are undeniable and it can also help reduce animal suffering while there may be challenges in certain cultural or social contexts there are ways to make the transition easier such as gradually reducing meat consumption exploring plant based alternatives and seeking support from nutritionists or healthcare professionals as a grade 12 student i believe that we has a responsibility to take action towards creating a better future and adopting a vegetarian or began diet is an excellent place to start",1,healthcare
" the future is a look of thresholds and arrivals someone somewhere is always discovering something a new species a new planet a new element in this continuum of finding and keeping we are constantly on the verge of something else the latest discovery is a new metal which assumes a vital role in the making of driverless cars they are coming this knowledge is weighted with expectation the intellectual equivalent of a buffet limitless possibilities and opportunities on one hand the arrival of the driverless car means the eradication of car accidents on the other hand it means the eradication of human error of the human factor the prospect of driverless cars evokes the notion of a world devoid of accidents does this mean a world devoid of human mistakes and the possibility of such a thing seems sinister like a nursery rhyme sun backwards

"i think the minimum wage should be raised in our country the minimum wage is the lowest hourly daily or monthly wage that an employer is legally required to pay its employees it is a contentious issue in many countries because some people think it will help workers while others think it will hurt businesses

one reason we should raise the minimum wage is that it will help workers earn a living wage a living wage is enough money to pay for the basic needs of life such as housing food and healthcare many people who work fulltime jobs still need government assistance to survive and thats not fair if we raise the minimum wage workers will earn more money and wont need help from the government

another reason we should raise the minimum wage is that it will help reduce poverty many people who work minimum wage jobs are poor and raising the minimum wage will give them a chance to earn more money and get out of poverty it will also help reduce income inequality which is when some people have a lot of money and others dont have enough

raising the minimum wage will also help businesses because workers will have more money to spend when workers get a raise they have more money to buy things like clothes food and other products this means that businesses will sell more products and that will help them make more money its a winwin situation

some people say that raising the minimum wage will hurt businesses because they will have to pay their workers more money but this isnt necessarily true businesses can afford to pay their workers a living wage and they should do it also raising the minimum wage will help businesses by giving them a more reliable workforce workers who earn a living wage are more likely to stay with their job longterm which means that businesses wont have to spend as much money training new workers

"climate change is real and its effects are already being felt rising sea levels more intense natural disasters and changing weather patterns are just a few examples of what were seeing the question is what are we going to do about it in my opinion governments need to take immediate action to address this issue before its too late

first of all lets talk about why climate change is such a big deal the science is clear human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which are causing the earths temperature to rise this warming is melting polar ice caps raising sea levels and changing weather patterns leading to more intense natural disasters if we dont do something to stop it the effects of climate change will only get worse

one of the biggest reasons we need governments to take action is that climate change is a global problem its not something that one country or even a group of countries can solve on their own it requires coordinated effort and cooperation from around the world governments have the power to implement policies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy technologies they can also provide funding for research and development of new technologies that can help us mitigate the effects of climate change

another reason governments need to take action is that climate change is already having a disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities rising sea levels are threatening coastal communities and more intense natural disasters are affecting communities that dont have the resources to recover from them governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and that includes taking action to address climate change

there are also economic reasons why governments should take action the cost of climate change is already being felt in terms of property damage lost productivity and healthcare costs according to a report by the international monetary fund the economic impact of climate change could be severe with losses estimated in the trillions of dollars by taking action now governments can help mitigate these costs and prevent them from getting worse in the future

finally taking action on climate change can create new economic opportunities investing in clean energy technologies can create jobs and stimulate economic growth according to a report by the international renewable energy agency the renewable energy sector could support up to 46 million jobs worldwide by 2050

of course there are those who argue that taking action on climate change will hurt the economy they say that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher energy costs and reduced economic growth but the science doesnt support this in fact studies have shown that taking action on climate change can actually boost economic growth while reducing emissions

in conclusion climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action from governments around the world the science is clear the impacts are already being felt and the economic costs are mounting governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens and take action to address this global problem by investing in clean energy technologies and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions governments can not only mitigate the effects of climate change but also create new economic opportunities its time for governments to take action and lead the way in addressing this critical issue",1,healthcare
" facial action coding system facs is a method used to describe and analyze human facial expressions it is a system developed by paul ekman and wallace v friesen in 1978 which has since gained widespread popularity in fields such as psychology neuroscience and even marketing facs is based on the idea that humans have a set of distinct facial expressions that are used to convey various emotions and attitudes in this essay we will discuss the basic principles behind facs and explore some of its applications

facs is based on the principle that facial expressions are complex actions that are executed by a series of specific muscle movements these movements can be observed and recorded using techniques such as electromyography emg and imaging technologies such as mri and eeg by analyzing these movements facs provides a systematic way to describe and categorize facial expressions

one of the key concepts in facs is the idea that there are basic emotion categories that are expressed differently across cultures the six basic emotions identified by facs are happiness sadness fear anger surprise and disgust each of these emotions is associated with a distinct set of muscle movements and facial expressions for example when smiling the zygomatic muscles at the sides of the mouth are activated while the corrugator muscles above the eyebrows are relaxed in contrast when frowning the corrugator muscles are activated while the zygomatic muscles are relaxed

in addition to basic emotions facs also provides a way to describe more nuanced facial expressions and attitudes for example different degrees of happiness can be expressed by varying the intensity and duration of the smile similarly different attitudes towards social situations can be conveyed through subtle changes in the shape of the eyebrows the position of the mouth and the activation of different muscle groups

facs has a wide range of applications in various fields in psychology it is used as a tool for analyzing and interpreting facial expressions in social situations it can be used to study how people express emotions in different contexts and how these expressions are perceived by others in marketing for example facs can be used to design advertisements that are more likely to elicit positive emotions in viewers such as happiness or excitement

in neuroscience facs provides a way to study the neural mechanisms underlying facial expressions by examining the muscle movements and facial expressions associated with different emotions researchers can gain a better understanding of how these emotions are processed and organized in the brain this information can be used to predict how individuals will respond to different stimuli and to develop more effective treatments for neurological disorders such as depression and anxiety

in medicine facs can be used to assess the facial expressions of patients with neurological disorders or medical conditions for example facial expressions in people with parkinsons disease or other movement disorders can reveal important information about their motor abilities and the severity of their symptoms similarly facial expressions in people with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders can provide insights into their emotional state and level of social functioning

in conclusion facial action coding system is a powerful tool for understanding and interpreting human facial expressions its ability to describe and categorize emotions and attitudes has made it an essential method in fields such as psychology neuroscience and marketing by analyzing muscle movements and facial expressions facs provides a systematic way to study the complex and nuanced human behavior with further research and development facs holds great promise for improving our understanding of the brain and the emotions that guide our lives",1,healthcare

however development must still overcome major technological obstacles before driverless cars are ready for roads en masse the article notes that sensors can be fooled and that software is not flawless while continuing to improve computers today still cannot perfectly identify every variable in traffic or respond appropriately to every unexpected scenario as a human driver can moreover with humans now removed from the decision making unforeseen ethical questions emerge such as who or what would be at fault in an accident and how autonomous vehicles should prioritize safety when faced with split second dilemmas these issues require rigorous scrutiny and standardization 

in conclusion while driverless cars promise revolutionary changes their development also brings risks that cannot be ignored considering the complex realities of driving and potential consequences of autonomous systems it is prudent to take a cautious approach thoroughly addressing technical and ethical concerns through extensive testing and standardization before these vehicles are introduced without human supervision on public roads continued progress is worthwhile but safely guided lives depend on getting driverless cars right",1,healthcare
"the chinese culture traditionally does not tell patients about their cancers in a frank manner this is often seen as being disrespectful to the patient and may cause them to feel overwhelmed and scared there are many reasons why this tradition may persist but one reason may be that the chinese believe that the patient should be the one to make the decision about whether or not to tell others about their illness this is often seen as being a personal matter and should not be shared with others without the patients consent

however with the development of modernization it is becoming more and more common for families to share information about their loved ones illnesses this is not only respectful to the patients but it also allows for better care and support there are many benefits to this change and it is important that we continue to move towards a more open and honest culture when it comes to cancer

"title the pros and cons of carfree cities

introduction

cities around the world are increasingly considering the concept of becoming carfree with many already implementing policies to promote sustainability and reduce air pollution this shift raises questions about how this transition will affect urban life and the overall quality of life in these areas in this essay we will explore both the pros and cons of carfree cities discussing their potential impact on transportation environment and social dynamics

pros of carfree cities
1 improved air quality with fewer cars on the roads cities would experience a dramatic decrease in air pollution caused by vehicle emissions this would lead to better public health as people would breathe cleaner air and experience reduced rates of respiratory illnesses
2 increased physical activity as walking and cycling become the primary modes of transportation citizens would become more physically active this would result in better cardiovascular health and reduced obesity rates
3 reduced noise levels cars create a significant amount of noise pollution especially in urban environments removing cars would significantly reduce noise levels making cities more pleasant places to live work and socialize
4 enhanced urban space with less space dedicated to parking lots and roads cities could repurpose these areas to create more parks pedestrian zones and bike lanes these changes would improve the aesthetics of the city making it more attractive to residents and tourists
5 environmental sustainability carfree cities would reduce the dependence on fossil fuels leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reduced carbon footprint this would contribute to global efforts to combat climate change

cons of carfree cities
1 limited accessibility in some cities a carfree lifestyle could be challenging for people with disabilities older adults or parents with strollers or heavy loads these groups would face increased difficulty accessing essential services shopping centers and healthcare facilities
2 economic impact removing cars from cities could negatively affect local businesses as people would be less likely to make purchases that require them to carry heavy items
3 increased traffic congestion while fewer cars may mean reduced traffic a significant increase in pedestrians and cyclists could lead to overcrowding and congestion this could potentially cause safety issues and slow down transportation times
4 social isolation removing cars from cities could potentially isolate certain groups of people who rely on their cars for social connections especially those living in remote areas or with fewer public transportation options
5 reduced mobility carfree cities might limit peoples mobility within and outside their city as it could be more difficult to travel to other cities or rural areas without a car

conclusion
the transition to carfree cities has both advantages and drawbacks which must be carefully weighed before implementing these policies while carfree cities would undoubtedly improve air quality encourage physical activity and enhance urban space they could also pose challenges for accessibility and mobilit",1,healthcare
"single use plastics have become a big problem in our world today they are hurting our environment and we need to do something about it thats why i think we should ban them

first single use plastics are not biodegradable they dont break down naturally and instead they just pile up in landfills and oceans this means that animals can eat them and get sick or even die for example sea turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them which can cause blockages in their digestive system

secondly single use plastics are made from nonrenewable resources like oil and gas these resources are finite which means that they will eventually run out we should not be wasting them on products that we only use once and then throw away instead we should be using them for more important things like fuel or medicine

another reason why we should ban single use plastics is that they are not recyclable most plastics cant be recycled and even if they can its not always done properly in fact a lot of plastic that is labeled as recyclable ends up in the ocean or in landfills this is because its not always possible to recycle plastic properly and its not always economically viable

furthermore single use plastics are not necessary we can easily replace them with reusable products like cloth bags stainless steel water bottles and metal straws these products are not only better for the environment but they are also more cost effective in the long run for example if you buy a reusable water bottle you wont have to keep buying new plastic bottles every time you want a drink of water

finally banning single use plastics will help to reduce pollution plastic pollution is a big problem and its not just affecting wildlife its also affecting humans plastic particles have been found in our food and water which can cause health problems by banning single use plastics we can reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in our environment and in our bodies

in conclusion banning single use plastics is the right thing to do they are bad for the environment they waste nonrenewable resources theyre not recyclable theyre not necessary and they pollute our world we need to take action now and ban single use plastics to protect our planet for future generations

"i believe that the minimum wage should be raised in our country because it will help reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for many individuals currently the minimum wage is not enough for people to afford necessities such as food housing and healthcare this is especially true for those who have families to support

however some argue that raising the minimum wage will lead to businesses cutting jobs or increasing prices to compensate for the increased labor costs while this may be true for some small businesses large corporations can afford to pay their employees a fair wage without negatively impacting their profits in fact many large corporations have already voluntarily raised their minimum wage in order to attract and retain talented workers

"the development of driverless cars 

the advent of driverless cars brings up an important debate about both the opportunities and risks that come with new technologies while autonomous vehicles offer certain benefits there are also real concerns that need to be addressed regarding their widespread adoption

one of the main promises of driverless cars outlined in the article is improved safety on our roads without human error factors like distraction fatigue or impairment autonomous vehicles could help significantly reduce accidents the data shows that over 90 of crashes today are due to human choices or mistakes by removing the human element from driving we may be able to save thousands of lives lost each year to preventable collisions at the same time allowing computers rather than people to navigate streets and highways raises legitimate questions will autonomous systems be able to handle every situation appropriately and respond flawlessly in emergencies there will likely need to be extensive testing and safeguards developed to ensure edge case scenarios are accounted for before we transition fully to driverless transport 

in addition to safety benefits the article discusses how autonomous vehicles could increase independence for many the elderly and disabled who can no longer drive themselves may regain mobility through the use of driverless cars being able to access employment healthcare and activities independently could profoundly help some populations however widespread reliance on this new technology also carries risks hf computer systems or infrastructure fail it could suddenly strip away a crucial form of transportation for vulnerable groups redundancies and alternatives would need to be in place to prevent potential crises overall access issues around cost would also need addressed for driverless cars to truly benefit all segments of society

in conclusion while driverless vehicles show promise in theory to resolve some problems their development raises hard questions that require careful consideration and oversight both the opportunities and risks around autonomous transport must continue to be studied and discussed as this technology progresses with appropriate testing safeguards and access ensured driverless cars could potentially offer a better and safer future for transportation however their widespread adoption should only move forward when concerns are sufficiently addressed and societal impacts are fully understood the development of autonomous vehicles is an issue with reasonable arguments on both sides and reasonable people can disagree on this complex topic",1,healthcare

"there is no easy answer when it comes to the question of whether to tell a cancer patient the truth on one hand it can be seen as cruel to withhold information that the patient has a life threatening illness on the other hand some people argue that it is better to not tell the patient in order to avoid causing them unnecessary stress and anxiety

in my opinion it is better to be honest with the patient first it is important to remember that a cancer diagnosis is not always a death sentence with early diagnosis and treatment many patients are able to beat the disease therefore it is important for the patient to be as informed as possible abort their condition

secondly hiding the truth from the patient can actually do more harm than good patients who are not given all the facts tend to become anxious and stressed this can actually hinder their recovery

finally i believe that patients have a right to know their diagnosis they should not be kept in the dark simply because their family members are afraid of upsetting them cancer patients need all the support they can get and that includes honest information from their loved ones

"the ongoing extinction of species is a growing concern and has been a hot topic of debate in recent years while it is true that the majority of extinctions in the history of our planet have been due to natural processes there is a strong case to be made for society to take extraordinary steps to protect endangered species this is especially true when the cost of doing so is relatively low in terms of money and jobs

one of the main arguments for taking action on endangered species is that it is our moral obligation to do so species extinction is a tragedy as it represents the loss of part of the planets biodiversity which has both aesthetic and ecological value ioreover in cases where human activities have directly or indirectly caused a species to become endangered we have a duty to make amends and take steps to mitigate the harm we have done

furthermore protecting endangered species can have tangible economic benefits iany species are keystone species meaning that their presence is integral to their ecosystems and their extinction could have a cascading effect for example the extinction of pollinators could lead to a collapse of the agricultural sector which could have devastating economic consequences

in addition to the moral and economic arguments there are also practical reasons why society should take action to save endangered species in many cases the cost of doing so is relatively low while the potential rewards are great for instance there are many species of plants and animals that if properly managed could provide valuable resources to society such as food medicine and timber

finally there is the argument that in order to ensure the long term survival of our planet we must take steps to protect endangered species this is especially true for species that are integral to their ecosystems as their extinction could have a destructive domino effect leading to the collapse of entire ecosystems

in conclusion there is a strong case to be made for society to take extraordinary steps to protect endangered species even when the cost of doing so is relatively high in terms of money and jobs this is due to the moral economic practical and ecological benefits of doing so as well as the potential long term consequences of letting species go extinct

"the rise of driverless technology

driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation as we know it while the development of such advanced vehicle autonomy introduces valid concerns on the whole driverless cars appear poised to significantly benefit society if properly implemented 

as the article points out driverless cars could improve traffic safety by eliminating human error the leading cause of motor vehicle accidents automated vehicles equipped with sensors and computers would not become distracted drunk drowsy or otherwise impaired in their driving abilities reducing accidents means saving lives as well as healthcare and insurance costs driverless technology also enables mobility for those unable to drive themselves such as the elderly or disabled 

of course developing a new technological system on such a large scale introduces uncertainties as the article notes cybersecurity risks could allow hackers to potentially access and control vehicles however with prudent safeguards these risks seem surmountable mandatory software updates and multilayered authentication could prevent unlawful takeovers of driverless systems additionally long term effects on employment are possible as commercial transport jobs become automated but new types of vehicle and traffic management jobs may also emerge to help offset potential job losses

on balance the benefits of driverless vehicles for improved traffic safety increased access and overall transportation efficiency appear to outweigh the challenges if technology developers and regulators work cooperatively to prioritize security and implement advances responsibly overall driverless cars could revolutionize transit for the better if prudently developed with care and oversight to address legitimate concerns these advanced vehicles may help build a safer and more accessible transportation future for all

in conclusion while driverless technology introduces risks that require attention its development promises major improvements to public safety and mobility if implemented judiciously on the whole and with prudent oversight driverless cars could mark an innovative and positive step forward for transportation",1,healthcare

"the world is constantly evolving and academic fields are no exception to stay relevant and effective these fields require independent thinkers who are not afraid to question the status quo and challenge established boundaries i completely agree with the statement that any academic field needs such independent thinkers to remain vigorous in this essay i will provide several reasons and examples to support my view

firstly independent thinkers bring fresh perspectives to academic fields which can help to break down barriers and unlock new ideas for example in the field of physics einsteins theory of relativity revolutionized the way we understand space and time his independent thinking allowed him to challenge the established view of newtonian physics and propose a completely new framework for understanding the universe

secondly independent thinkers are often willing to take risks and explore unconventional ideas this willingness to challenge longstanding assumptions can lead to breakthroughs that would have been impossible within the confines of established boundaries for instance in the field of medicine the discovery of penicillin was a result of alexander flemings willingness to explore the effects of mold on bacterial growth his discovery was a major breakthrough in the treatment of infectious diseases and has saved countless lives

finally independent thinkers can help to prevent academic fields from becoming stagnant by keeping them open to new ideas and approaches this is particularly important in rapidly changing fields such as technology where the pace of innovation can be dizzying in this context independent thinkers can act as catalysts for change driving progress and pushing the boundaries of what is possible

however it is important to note that independent thinking can also be risky when challenging established boundaries it is possible to encounter resistance from those who are invested in maintaining the status quo this can lead to a lack of support or even outright opposition which can be discouraging for independent thinkers moreover independent thinking can also lead to controversial ideas that are not universally accepted

in conclusion i strongly believe that any academic field needs independent thinkers to remain vigorous these thinkers bring fresh perspectives are willing to take risks and prevent fields from becoming stagnant however it is important to recognize the risks associated with independent thinking and the potential for resistance to new ideas despite this i remain optimistic about the power of independent thinking to unlock new ideas and change the world

"i believe that the minimum wale should be raised in our country because it will help reduce poverty and improve the standard of living for many individuals currently the minimum wale is not enough for people to afford necessities such as food housing and healthcare this is especially true for those who have families to support

raising the minimum wale will also stimulate the economy by increasing the purchasing power of individuals when people have more money to spend they are more likely to buy goods and services which will create more jobs and boost economic growth additionally it will reduce the burden on government social welfare programs as people will be able to support themselves and their families without relying on government assistance

however some argue that raising the minimum wale will lead to businesses cutting jobs or increasing prices to compensate for the increased labor costs while this may be true for some small businesses large corporations can afford to pay their employees a fair wale without relatively impacting their profits in fact many large corporations have already voluntarily raised their minimum wale in order to attract and retain talented workers

in conclusion raising the minimum wale is necessary to improve the lives of many individuals and families in our country it will help reduce poverty stimulate the economy and reduce the burden on government social welfare programs while there may be some short term challenges for businesses the longer benefits for workers and the economy as a whole outweigh these concerns",1,healthcare

"driverless cars also known as autonomous vehicles are quickly becoming a reality in todays world these cars are equipped with various technologies that allow them to navigate roads and highways without human drivers they are programmed to sense their surroundings using advanced sensors cameras and radar making them capable of identifying obstacles and reacting accordingly
one major advantage of driverless cars is increased road safety human error accounts for the majority of car accidents so eliminating the human factor can significantly lower the number of accidents on the road moreover driverless cars have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and improve overall efficiency in transportation by communicating with each other and adapting to traffic conditions these vehicles can move more efficiently reducing delays and improving travel time this in turn could reduce air pollution and lower the demand for new roads or parking facilities
another benefit of driverless cars is improved mobility for individuals with disabilities or limited mobility these cars would allow them to travel more freely independently and safely they would also provide a convenient and affordable means of transportation for elderly individuals who may not be comfortable or capable of driving themselves
however the widespread adoption of driverless cars presents several challenges one major concern is the potential security vulnerabilities associated with the technology hackers could potentially take control of the vehicles leading to serious consequences in addition issues such as privacy concerns insurance liability and ethical dilemmas may arise as the technology advances

"hey there its me an average 8th grader  im super excited to write this essay about why its important to be yourself and not let others influence who you are i know i know its like totally cliché but hear me out okay

first lets talk about how cool it is to be different like seriously being different is what makes us unique and special if we were all the same as ugh that would be so boring think about it if everyone liked the same music wore the same clothes and had the same interests the world would be a total snooze fest but because were all different we have this amazing diversity that makes life interesting

now i know it can be tough to be different especially when others dont understand or appreciate it like im super into art and music but some of my friends are more into sports and video games they dont get why im not as into those things and sometimes they make fun of me for it but you know what i dont care im still going to be myself and pursue my passions even if others dont get it

another reason why its important to be yourself is because of confidence when youre true to yourself youre more confident in your abilities and what you stand for like if youre into science and math dont let someone tell you that youre not good enough at it youre still going to be better at it than they are even if they think youre not and trust me confidence is key in life it helps you tackle challenges and not give up when things get tough

so ive been doing some research on how to change my first impression like i know im not the most outgoing person in the world but i want to make sure people see me for whwhom really am  a cool fun and smart person 

one thing i learned is that first impression techniques are super important like have you ever noticed how people tend to mirror the other persons body language  its like if youre standing up straight and making eye contact theyre more likely to think youre confident and stuff  and who doesnt want to be seen as confident 

another thing i found out is that impression management is a real thing like you can actually control how people see you by what you say and do  its like if you want to be seen as funny you should tell jokes or make funny faces and if you want to be seen as smart you should talk about things youre interested in and actually know about 

but heres the thing managing your impression is not just about trying to be someone youre not its about being authentic and genuine like dont try to be someone youre not but also dont be afraid to show off your unique personality  its like be you but also be youer

"social media has become a big part oi our lives and its hard to imaging a world without it but with the good comes the bad theres been a lot oi talk about privacy protections on social media and ii theyre really needed in my opinion privacy protections are a must

first oi all think about all the personal information we share on social media we post pictures oi our families our friends and our vacations we share our thoughts and feelings and sometimes even our address and phone number all oi this information can be accessed by anyone even people we dont know its like putting all our personal studio out there ior the world to see without any protection

another reason why privacy protections are important is because oi cyberbullying cyberbullying is when someone is mean or harasses someone online it can be really hurtful and sometimes even dangerous ii there were stronger privacy protections it would be harder ior bullies to find their victims and less likely ior them to be able to contact them

also have you ever searched ior something online and then suddenly you start seeing ads ior it everywhere you go on the internet its like your computer is watching you its kind oi creepy and it makes you wonder what else can be seen this is where privacy protections come in ii social media companies have stronger privacy protections they couldnt collect as much information about us and use it ior ads

finally theres the issue oi data breaches this is when a companys information is stolen or hacked and its a big problem ii social media companies had stronger privacy protections it would be harder ior hackers to get their hands on our information think about it would you want your information just floating around out there ior anyone to take no way

now some people might argue that privacy protections are not needed they might say that we have control over what we share and that we should just be careful about what we post but thats not always the case sometimes we post things without thinking about who might see them or we might not realize how much information were sharing its easy to accidentally post something we didnt mean to and once its out there its hard to take back

"dear senator

i am writing to advocate for changing the way we elect the president of the united states to a popular vote system instead of the current electoral college while the electoral college was designed with the intention of giving smaller states more influence it no longer serves that purpose and has some significant downsides  

one argument often made in favor of keeping the electoral college is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states however research shows that in recent elections candidates spend almost all their time campaigning in only a handful of swing states that could vote either way this means that over 90 of americans see little to no campaigning it is also possible for a candidate to lose the national popular vote but win the electoral college as happened in 2000 and 2016 this undermines the principle of one person one vote

whos in favor of keeping the status quo argue it protects the interests of smaller states however todays system does not guarantee smaller states more attention candidates still focus their efforts on a few key swing states and larger population centers within those states a popular vote system would motivate candidates to campaign across the entire nation in order to win more total votes it would not mean that candidates visit some states more than others 

a popular vote could increase voter turnout which in recent elections has been very low especially among young people if every vote carried the same weight more people may feel their ballots really count towards selecting the nations leader this could have the effect of increasing civic participation overall a system where the candidate with the most votes wins the presidency seems the most straightforward and fair interpretation of democratic principles while reasonable arguments can be made either way i believe changing to a popular vote is the reform that best addresses the weaknesses in our current process

" phones and driving a balancing act

as technology continues to advance smartphones have become an indispensable part of our daily lives with instant access to information communication entertainment and much more its easy to see how these devices have become so popular however when it comes to using our phones behind the wheel the potential consequences can be dire

as we all know texting and driving is not safe and in many countries it is illegal the average text message takes a drivers eyes off the road for about 46 seconds which is enough time to cause a devastating accident according to the national highway traffic safety administration drivers who are texting are 23 times more likely to crash than nontexting drivers

one of the main reasons phones have become so tempting while driving is the constant need to stay connected with the rise of social media and email people are constantly bombarded with notifications messages and calls that demand their attention unfortunately this can lead to reckless driving and even accidents

another reason phones and driving dont mix is the potential for distraction whether its playing games listening to music or watching videos smartphones can be incredibly distracting even when used for handsfree calls or texting drivers need to maintain a high level of focus to keep themselves and others safe on the road and any distraction can be dangerous

despite these dangers many people continue to use their phones behind the wheel often blaming their distractions on external factors such as boredom or lack of entertainment however its important to remember that it is our responsibility to stay safe and pay attention while driving regardless of how we feel or what were doing

so what can we do to balance our need for phones with our need to stay safe behind the wheel first and foremost we need to be mindful of our habits and make a conscious effort to put our phones away while driving we should also make an effort to find other ways to stay entertained or occupied while driving such as listening to music or reading a book

in addition to these individual efforts car manufacturers and lawmakers are also working to address the issue of phones and driving many cars now come equipped with handsfree calling and texting features which can help to reduce distractions while still allowing drivers to stay connected lawmakers are also implementing stricter penalties for texting and driving including fines and even license suspensions in an effort to deter drivers from using their phones while behind the wheel

in conclusion phones and driving are a delicate balance and its up to each and every one of us to strike that balance and stay safe on the road while smartphones have become an integral part of our daily lives we need to be mindful of our habits and make a conscious effort to stay focused while driving with a little bit of effort and a balanced approach we can enjoy the convenience of our phones without putting ourselves or others in danger",1,science

" limiting car usage has become a trend in many countries and cities around the world in germany there is a community called vauban that has completely banned the use of cars this experiment in local suburban life has shown a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the united states the concept of smart planning which involves separating suburban life from auto use is being adopted around the world to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation with less space for parking

in the united states the environmental protection agency is promoting reduced communities and legislators are starting to act if cautiously paris recently banned driving for five days to clear the air of smog resulting in a 60 percent drop in congestion and a significant reduction in emissions delivery companies complained of lost revenue but exceptions were made for plugin cars hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers public transit was free during this time

the trend of limiting car usage is not without controversy however some argue that cars provide a necessary form of transportation and that limiting their use would cause inconvenience and harm to the economy others argue that the benefits of reducing emissions and improving air quality outweigh the costs

one study found that americans are buying fewer cars and driving less which could be attributed to a shift in american behavior this trend has been accelerating since 2005 and it is likely to continue the car industry is already rebranding itself as a mobility company with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle

in conclusion limiting car usage has several advantages it can lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality the trend of smart planning which involves separating suburban life from auto use is being adopted around the world to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation while there may be some inconvenience and economic costs the benefits of reducing emissions and improving air quality outweigh the costs",1,science

next i asked my friends and family what type of character trait they think i possess some said im pretty outgoing and social while others said im more reserved and independent it was interesting to see how different people can have different perspectives on my personality 

after that i ututilizednline resources to learn more about character traits and how they can affect our personalities i found out that our personality traits can influence how we behave in different social situations and how we interact with others for instance if youre an extravert you might do better in a group setting than someone whos more introverted

now i had to reflect on my own behavior in different social situations and try to figure out which personality type best fits me i rerealizedhat im actually a mix of different traits but i tend to lean more towards being an introvert im not super outgoing or social like some people but im also not super reserved or independent like others i furthermore iuess you could say im more of a mixandmatch kind of personality

" the article driverless cars are coming discusses the merits and drawbacks of autonomous vehicles the benefits include increased safety as 90 of car accidents are caused by human error the roads would also be more efficient as autonomous vehicles could travel closer together finally autonomous vehicles could be programmed to be electric or use other clean energy sources benefiting the environment 

however the article also discusses some drawbacks of autonomous vehicles one of the biggest concerns is the potential loss of jobs for taxi drivers truck drivers and others who drive for a living there are also questions about who would be liable in the event of an accident the car manufacturer the software company that wrote the cars programming or another party another concern is the possibility of hacking into the cars systems and taking control away from the person inside 

in conclusion autonomous vehicles have both benefits and drawbacks on the one hand they have the potential to make roads safer and more efficient and reduce carbon emissions on the other hand they could put many people out of work and potentially be dangerous if hacked more research and testing must be done before these cars can become a common sight on the road 

 cwe misinterpreted fact i misinterpreted a fact about driverless cars in my introduction driverless cars are actually much safer than cars with human drivers but i claimed that they had the potential to be safer than human driven cars this misinterpretation of a fact undermines the rest of my essay which is otherwise fact based and analytical",1,science

emerging as an essential aspect of the united states political framework the electoral college plays a pivotal role in electing the president of the country while this system of electing the president was created with good intentions it has been frequently criticized for a variety of reasons in this essay the purpose is not to debate justify or completely defend or criticize the system rather it is to provide an unbiased understanding of the working of the electoral college address its potential benefits and discuss some of its drawbacks to shed light on the complex nature of american politics

before delving into the pros and cons of the electoral college we must first understand its purpose and function the main purpose of the electoral college is to ensure that the american people have a say in determining who becomes the president through elected electors appointed via democratic elections held in each of the fifty us states and district of columbia in practice the electors represent the voters in their respective areas and they cast their votes for the candidates in the presidential election

one of the often raised arguments about the electoral college system is that it encourages states which may get overlooked in a popular vote system to take part actively in the election process this has led to a more comprehensive and diverse view being considered before making decisions the electoral college allows minorities in the country to have a say even if they dont have a majority which would not be feasible in a direct popular vote scenario furthermore it provides smaller states an equal opportunity to participate in the presidential election process as bigger states given that each state gets an equal number of electoral college votes

however there are certain negative aspects and concerns regarding the electoral colleges function since 1888 us elections have seen close decisions where the winner did not gain a majority of the total popular vote for instance donald trump losing the popular vote but winning the election in 2016 the winnertakesall system employed by the majority of states could potentially encourage politicians to focus on gaining only a particular group of electors thus ignoring the votes and interests of other segments in the country

another criticism of the electoral college system is the disproportionality issue faced by some states where their electoral votes are not necessarily aligned with their actual population this creates a situation where small states have more electoral significance despite having fewer people than other states this can create a misrepresentation of the national population in the election leaving some regions and segments with lesser weight when it comes to electing the president

moreover the electoral college can make it possible for a candidate to win without actually securing the majority of the total votes as we have observed in past elections if the electoral college votes were not involved its entirely possible that candidates who did not manage to win may have garnered more support than the actual winners this may lead to some political leaders being questioned about their legitimacy making it difficult for the country to move forward in a truly unified way

additionally the electoral system might encourage polarized presidential elections as it leads candidates to focus on attracting support from a distinct core constituency rather than appealing to undecided or potential voters this might result in a campaign that does not truly reflect the diverse range of concerns and opinions of the entire population but just serves those who are determined to play in the political arena

despite the drawbacks mentioned above that seem to undermine the electoral system people should consider that the structure of the electoral system is designed by the constitution and has successfully existed for more than two hundred years without major changes over such a long period numerous debates and experiments on the electoral system have taken shape while the foundational elements of the system remain mostly unchanged as we explore the complexities of the presidential election within the political environment its vital to understand the historical context motivations and reasons for its longstanding presence in the american system

in conclusion the electoral college as a part of the united states political framework can be perceived as having both advantages and disadvantages regarding its functioning however since it is a deeply rooted aspect of the constitution and has been a part of the countrys political infrastructure for such a long time attempts to modify or change it for the sake of simplifying things may negatively impact other aspects that still prove valuable in providing a unique balance instead it is crucial for citizens to continue participating actively in the political process to ensure a fair representative democratic process regardless of which system is in place",1,science

"the development of driverless cars

while driverless cars present numerous technological benefits their widespread adoption also carries risks that warrant caution in their development according to the article proponents argue that driverless cars could significantly reduce accidents and free up time previously spent driving however replacing human drivers with computers also introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities and reliability questions that need addressed before removing human oversight entirely  

on the one hand the article notes that around 90 of car accidents are currently caused by human error due to factors like distraction fatigue or drunkenness by replacing fallible humans with computers programmed solely to drive safely proponents estimate driverless cars could prevent hundreds of thousands of accidents annually in the us alone additionally the time no longer spent actively driving could be used productively for work or leisure activities these safety and efficiency benefits provide a compelling case for developing this technology

however the article also acknowledges potential downsides fully replacing human drivers with computers raises serious cybersecurity concerns as malicious hackers could potentially gain control of vehicles to cause accidents or even weaponize them additionally it remains unknown how driverless cars will handle unexpected situations that fall outside of programming such as complex emergencies or hazardous weather conditions until extensive real world testing and refinements are made to demonstrate safety and reliability under all conditions keeping human oversight as a failsafe seems prudent 

in conclusion while driverless cars show exciting potential to revolutionize transportation and significantly boost safety their development needs to carefully balance these benefits with cybersecurity dependability and human control concerns fore testing and safeguards are required before removing humans entirely from vehicle operation for the protection of passengers and the public regulators must reasonably ensure driverless cars are thoroughly proven to handle any situation safely before allowing their mainstream adoption without human drivers when the technology matures to completely alleviate these risks driverless cars could transform the world for the better but for now a cautious approach is warranted",1,science

the idea of finding evidence of extraterrestrial life has been a topic of fascination for humans for centuries one of the most famous cases of this fascination was the discovery of the face on mars by nasas viking spacecraft the image sparked intrigue and fueled conspiracy theories about the possibility of intelligent life on mars however nasas mars global surveyor later revealed that the face was just a natural landform in this essay i will use claims and evidence from the article unmasking the face on mars to argue that the face is in fact a natural landform

body

the first claim that supports my argument is that nasas mars global surveyor revealed that the face was not a manmade structure but rather a natural landform the images taken by the spacecraft showed that the face was similar to earths buttes which are natural formations caused by erosion this claim is supported by the article which states that images revealed it as a natural landform akin to earths buttes or mesas

the second claim that supports my argument is that laser altimetry confirmed that the face was a natural formation similar to other cydonian mesas laser altimetry is a technique used to measure the height of landforms using lasers the data collected by this technique showed that the face was just one of many mesas in the area that had been shaped by natural processes this claim is supported by the article which states that laser altimetry confirmed its natural origins similar to other cydonian mesas

the third claim that supports my argument is that the geological interest of cydonia lies in its location at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary this suggests that the landforms in the area including the face were shaped by natural processes related to the presence of water on mars this claim is supported by the article which states that cydonias geological interest lies in its location at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary

conclusion

in conclusion the face on mars is just a natural landform similar to earths buttes or mesas the claims that support this conclusion are that nasas mars global surveyor revealed the face to be a natural formation laser altimetry confirmed its natural origins and the geological interest of cydonia lies in its location at a potential ancient martian ocean boundary the evidence for these claims comes from the unmasking the face on mars article therefore it is not a manmade structure and is not evidence of intelligent life on mars the search for extraterrestrial life continues but we must rely on scientific evidence to support our claims",1,science

exploring venuss atmosphere
one of the most fascinating and puzzling aspects of venus is its thick planetwide corrosive acidic cloud cover which prevents a direct view of its surface investigations about its atmosphere is also a significant aspect that the aforementioned missions are keen to explore this impenetrable veil has hindered our understanding of the planets surface temperature and other geological processes that occur beneath

surface characteristics
to date the limited available data suggests that venuss surface might include a variety of landforms with some resembling earths mountains plains and canyons however a clear picture of the planets topography remains elusive due to the aforementioned cloud cover current and forthcoming missions are expected to help clarify venuss unique landscapes and geologic features

possible conditions for life on venus
despite venuss extreme surface conditions and environment its ability to host life should not be dismissed out of hand previous studies have suggested that the harsh atmospheric conditions have likely caused changes over time scientists are curious about venuss past as the planet may have had a wetter or milder environment that could have provided more suitable conditions for life in its youth future missions also bear the potential to find microbial life if present that may exist in the upper levels of venuss atmosphere or within the cloud deck

conclusion
exploring venuss unknown territories from the vast differences in its geological climatic and geographical features promises to provide vital clues about the origins of earth while also deepening our understanding of solar system formation the current knowledge about venus should be seen only as an infinitesimal portion of what remains to be discovered about this mysterious sister planet as we continue to pursue this quest with missions like veritas davinci and shukrayaan1 it is evident that our search for answers will not only expand our knowledge about venus but also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the cosmos",1,science
"title the rise of driverless cars revolutionizing transportation for a safer future

driverless cars also known as autonomous vehicles represent a groundbreaking technological advancement in the world of transportation these cars have the ability to navigate roads without human input relying on advanced sensors software and artificial intelligence to perceive their surroundings and make decisions accordingly the concept of driverless cars has been gaining traction in recent years with numerous automakers technology companies and government organizations investing in its development and implementation this essay will delve into the potential benefits and challenges of driverless cars exploring why they are set to revolutionize our transportation landscape
one of the primary advantages of driverless cars lies in their ability to significantly enhance road safety human drivers are responsible for the vast majority of accidents with factors such as distracted driving fatigue and impaired judgement contributing to crashes by removing human error and decisionmaking from the equation driverless cars have the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road
moreover driverless cars have the capacity to increase mobility for individuals who might otherwise struggle to drive themselves due to age physical limitations or disabilities these cars could provide an affordable accessible and convenient transportation option for people who cannot currently drive themselves
additionally driverless cars have the potential to reduce traffic congestion and improve overall traffic flow by communicating with one another and navigating the roads with greater efficiency than human drivers driverless cars can minimize the need for braking and lane changes thereby reducing the time it takes to travel from one location to another
furthermore driverless cars can be more environmentally friendly by optimizing the use of fuel and minimizing idling time at traffic lights driverless cars have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and overall energy consumption
while driverless cars offer many potential benefits there are also some challenges that need to be addressed one major concern is cybersecurity as these cars rely heavily on complex computer systems and connectivity with the internet hackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the system posing a threat to the safety of driverless car passengers
another concern relates to the ethical implications of autonomous vehicles in the event of an unavoidable accident how should these vehicles be programmed to prioritize the safety of their passengers or pedestrians
despite these challenges the development of driverless cars is an inevitable and exciting advancement in transportation technology governments automakers and technology companies are investing heavily in research and testing to ensure the safe and efficient implementation of autonomous vehicles as we move closer to a future with autonomous vehicles on our roads it is important to address these concerns and ensure that the benefits of this innovation are maximized while minimizing any potential drawbacks",1,science

"the face on mars is a fascinating subject that has sparked numerous discussions theories and debates among space enthusiasts scientists and the general public alike the face on mars is a feature on the martian surface which appears to resemble a human face when observed closely
first discovered by the viking 1 orbiter in 1976 the feature has been the subject of intense study and speculation since then some people have suggested that this face is evidence of intelligent life beyond earth while others believe that it is simply a geological formation or an optical illusion created by light and shadows
one of the most compelling theories behind the face on mars is that it is the result of a natural process known as pareidolia pareidolia is the psychological phenomenon where people perceive familiar shapes and patterns even when they are not really there this can be seen in the way some people see the image of jesus christ on a piece of toast or the virgin mary in a stain on the wall in the case of the face on mars it is believed that the combination of lighting shadows and the unique shape of the martian surface has led people to perceive the face
another possible explanation for the face on mars is that it is a geological formation specifically a mesa a mesa is a flattopped hill with steep sides and it is not uncommon to observe such formations on mars it is possible that the unique shape of the mesa and the presence of some dark patches have given the illusion of a face
in conclusion whether or not the face on mars is a result of intelligent life pareidolia or a natural formation it has undoubtedly sparked curiosity and discussion among people who are fascinated by the mysteries of our universe as more information is gathered through exploration and scientific research we may gain further understanding of the face on mars but for now it remains an intriguing subject for debate and contemplation",1,science

one reason why i am against animal testing is that there are now many alternatives available scientists can use computer models cell cultures and other nonanimal methods to conduct their research these methods are often more accurate and reliable than animal testing and they do not cause any harm to animals

another reason why i am against animal testing is that it is often ineffective animals and humans have different biological systems so the results of animal testing may not be applicable to humans many drugs that have been tested on animals have failed in human trials which shows that animal testing is not a reliable method for predicting the safety and efficacy of drugs

in addition animal testing is often unnecessary many products that are tested on animals such as cosmetics and cleaning products are not essential for our survival we can easily find alternative products that have not been tested on animals so there is no need to subject animals to cruel and painful experiments for these purposes

despite its distinctive appearance the exact origin of the face on mars remains a subject of debate among scientists some believe that the feature is the result of a massive volcanic eruption while others believe that it was formed by the action of water and wind over millions of years regardless of its formation the face on mars is an important geological feature that provides valuable insights into the planets ancient history and the forces that shaped its surface

one theory about the formation of the face on mars is that it was created by a massive volcanic eruption that occurred on the planet billions of years ago scientists believe that a nearby volcano olympus mons erupted catastrophically sending a massive amount of material flying into the sky and creating a huge dust storm that covered the entire planet over time the dust settled and the features on the surface were weathered and eroded resulting in the creation of the smooth undulating surface of the face on mars

another theory about the formation of the face on mars is that it was created by the action of water and wind over millions of years according to this theory water flowed down the mountains and valleys of mars carving out channels and eroding the surface of the planet over time the forces of wind and erosion continued to shape the landscape creating the smooth and undulating surface of the face on mars

regardless of its formation the face on mars is an important geological feature that provides valuable insights into the planets ancient history and the forces that shaped its surface scientists believe that the feature is composed of a variety of materials including rocks sand and dust and that it may be the result of volcanic activity water erosion or a combination of both the study of the face on mars offers a unique opportunity to learn more about the geological processes that shaped the planets surface and to investigate the role of water and other forces in shaping the habitability of the planet

despite its scientific importance the face on mars has also captured the imagination of the general public becoming a popular icon of the planet and a source of inspiration for a range of artistic and cultural expressions the feature has been portrayed in countless works of art literature and media including books movies and television shows and has become a symbol of the mystery and wonder of the universe

in conclusion the face on mars is a fascinating and mysterious geological feature that has captured the attention of both scientists and the general public for over a century while its exact origin remains a subject of debate the feature offers valuable insights into the planets ancient history and the forces that shaped its surface whether formed by volcanic activity or the action of water and wind the face on mars is an important geological feature that continues to inspire awe and wonder in all who behold it",1,science

benefit 2 enhanced resource efficiency

autonomous cars have a potential to promote a sustainable and smart transportation system by reducing fuel and other resource consumption driverless cars would operate in a way that enables them to make optimal decisions to avoid traffic jams find alternate routes as needed and use fuel more efficiently this could lead to significantly reduced travel times fewer greenhouse gas emissions and energy conservation all of which are essential factors as the world works towards a more sustainable future

there are also economic implications of driverless cars that can potentially be beneficial the improved efficiency of transportation and reduced need for personal vehicle ownership due to car sharing could mean less parking and housing space demand freeing up previously scarce urban areas for alternative uses driverless cars may even help to optimize public transportation systems making them more attractive as well

challenge 1 adapting to changes in current traffic systems and infrastructure

existing roadways and infrastructure were built primarily for humandriven cars adding driverless vehicles to the mix will require changes such as updated traffic lights signage and potential modifications to roads and infrastructure new standards and guidelines would also need to be established to ensure proper functioning of driverless cars ensuring they cooperate with traditional vehicles while minimizing congestion moreover the widespread integration of automated cars into urban environments may cause significant societal adjustments leading to changes in the structure and layout of cities and road networks


challenge 2 cybersecurity and privacy concerns

similar to any emerging digital technology driverless cars will be susceptible to cybersecurity threats due to their extensive usage of electronics software and wireless interconnectivity with other vehicles and infrastructure the lack of knowledge about longterm hacking vulnerabilities could pose considerable risks including the potential to manipulate vehicle behavior for malicious purposes privacy concerns must also be addressed considering the vehicles may routinely capture images track personal mobility data or transmit other driver information it cannot be emphasized enough that data safety will be crucial in ensuring public trust

challenge 3 reassessing public acceptance and readiness

the development of driverless cars will face significant barriers including public attitudes cultural acceptance and potential resistance this resistance could stem from the fear of losing control over a vehicle concerns about safety measures job displacement which could arise due to the decrease in laborintensive public transportation and other unforeseen social challenges policymakers urban planners and manufacturers must work towards mitigating public concerns by ensuring the safety reliability and transparency of automated vehicle technologies

conclusion

as technology continues to advance at exponential rates and with the introduction of new innovations such as driverless cars there are bound to be both positive and negative implications for our cities infrastructure and society overall while the potential benefits such as improved traffic safety decreased resource consumption and the opportunity to leverage new modes of public transportation seem rather promising it is crucial to also acknowledge and prepare for the challenges they may bring including adapting to our current infrastructure resolving cybersecurity concerns and winning over public acceptance by addressing the challenges and capitalizing on the benefits brought by driverless cars it is possible to usher in a safer more efficient and sustainable transportation system for our growing urban environments",1,science

in conclusion while studying venus presents clear hazards the author makes a persuasive case that it remains a worthy scientific target the potential insights gained into comparative planetology and climate change processes could substantially advance understanding continued efforts tl develop technologies able tl withstand venusian conditions are justified given the opportunity tl directly examine another terrestrial world the author effectively supports the idea that studying venus despite its dangers is worthwhile flr advancing science",1,science
"the image of the face on mars captured in 1976 by nasas viking 1 spacecraft has been one of the most intriguing mysteries for decades conspiracy theorists have long speculated that it is proof of an alien civilization on mars however recent evidence suggests that the face is not the creation of extraterrestrial life but rather a natural geological formation as a scientist at nasa i am convinced that the face on mars is merely a butte or mesa similar to those found on earth

to start the face on mars is located in cydonia an area of mars that was once thought to have been an ancient martian ocean boundary this geological feature is similar to those found on earth where buttes and mesas are formed when softer surrounding rock is eroded over time leaving the harder rock to stand out prominently this is also supported by the fact that other mesas in the cydonia region have similar geological features to the face therefore it is reasonable to assume that the face on mars is also a natural formation created by geological processes

furthermore in 1997 nasas mars global surveyor captured detailed images of the face on mars that revealed it to be nothing more than a natural butte or mesa the images show that the face has features that are consistent with a natural formation including erosion patterns and a lack of symmetry these images also showed that other features in the area such as craters and rock formations are consistent with an ancient martian ocean boundary thus it is clear that the face on mars has no evidence of artificial creation

finally laser altimetry a technique used to measure the elevation of a surface was used to study the face on mars the data obtained from laser altimetry showed that the face has a natural elevation and shape that is consistent with other mesas in the area this data provides strong evidence that the face on mars is not the work of an alien race but merely a natural landform

in conclusion the face on mars may be an intriguing mystery but the evidence points to it being a natural geological formation rather than a creation of an alien civilization the geological features of the area the detailed images captured by nasas mars global surveyor and the results of laser altimetry all support the idea that the face on mars is a natural butte or mesa while it may be disappointing to some that there is no evidence of alien life on mars the discovery of the face on mars still has significant scientific value in understanding the geological history of our neighboring planet as a scientist at nasa i firmly believe that the face on mars is simply a natural wonder and not the work of aliens",1,science

"title understanding the facial action coding system and its importance in emotional expression studies

introduction
the facial action coding system facs is a widely used tool in the field of emotional expression studies it helps researchers and psychologists analyze and categorize different facial movements providing valuable insights into human emotions communication and social interactions in this essay i will discuss the facs in detail including its history principles applications and significance in understanding emotions and human behavior
history
the facial action coding system was developed by dr paul ekman an american psychologist and dr walter fries a german psychologist they first introduced the system in 1978 in their joint paper facial actions a semiotic approach the facs is based on the pioneering work by carlherman hjortsjö who created a system of facial movement notation in the 1960s
principles
the facial action coding system is based on the assumption that human facial expressions are composed of discrete movements that can be identified described and categorized ekman and fries developed a set of 43 distinct facial actions or akhmans which they divided into 12 basic facial expressions also called action units or aus these basic facial expressions represent the most essential components of human facial expressions
applications
the facial action coding system has been extensively applied in various fields including psychology psychiatry and forensics some common applications of the facs include
1 emotional recognition the facs helps researchers identify and understand the subtle facial movements associated with different emotions by analyzing these facial movements scientists can gain insights into the emotional states and intentions of individuals
2 emotional disorders facs can be used to detect and assess emotional disorders such as depression or anxiety by studying the facial expressions of individuals with these conditions researchers can gain a better understanding of how these disorders impact their emotional expressions and communication
3 lie detection the facs has also been used in forensic contexts particularly in lie detection by analyzing the facial movements and microexpressions of individuals during interviews experts can identify inconsistencies and deception potentially aiding in criminal investigations
4 crosscultural research the facs has played a crucial role in understanding the universality of human emotions across cultures by analyzing facial expressions in various cultures scientists can identify commonalities and differences in the way emotions are expressed
5 autism spectrum disorder the facs has been used as a tool for assessing individuals with autism spectrum disorder asd by studying their facial expressions and social skills researchers can use facs to better understand the challenges that individuals with asd face in communicating and expressing emotion
significance
the facs has significantly impacted our understanding of human emotions communicatio",1,science
" the world has been transformed by technology which has evolved in various industries throughout human history people now communicate and perform various tasks using technology but it is not inherently good or bad it has different emotions associated with it such as when playing video games and interacting with others online

on one hand technology has brought about numerous benefits such as the ability to buy books and food online through amazon there are also many companies working in news and entertainment creating videos and games that people can enjoy social media platforms like instagram and facebook have become incredibly popular allowing people to connect with friends and family all over the world

however the impact of technology on people is not always positive the community has insinuated that technology is bad but this is not the case the technology we have created is a reflection of our humanity and it can be used for both good and bad purposes for example technology has brought about advancements in weapons and transportation which have allowed us to fight and explore new places

in conclusion technology is not inherently good or bad it has both positive and negative effects on people depending on how it is used fe can use technology to bring about good things but we must be mindful of its potential negative consequences",1,science
"first impressions are a critical aspect of human interaction they are tle initial perceptions that people lave of each other and they can greatly influence low they interact with each other in tle future first impressions can be formed based on a wide range of factors including appearance behavior and personality traits however tle question is letter first impressions can be clanged or if they are set in stone

from my personal experience i lave found that first impressions can be clanged to some extent for example when i first met my best friend i was initially hesitant to get to know them however as we spent more time together i began to see a different side to them and my initial impression was slowly clanged this experience taught met lat first impressions are not always accurate and that people can change based on their experiences and interactions with others

additionally research leis shown that first impressions can be clanged through conscious effort for instance studies lave shown that people can change their body language and tone of voice to make themselves appear more approachable and friendly this can help to counteract negative first impressions and create a more positive one

however while first impressions can be clanged to some extent they are not always completely changeable for example in tle case of animals first impressions can be based on physical characteristics such as size shape and color once an animal leis formed a first impression of a person it can be difficult to change that impression for instance a dog may be wary of a person based on their size or appearance and even if tle person tries to change their behavior tle dog may still be hesitant to interact with them

in conclusion first impressions are an important aspect of human interaction and they can greatly influence low people interact with each other in tle future while first impressions can be clanged to some extent through conscious effort they are not always completely changeable it is important to be aware of first impressions and to strive to create a positive one as this can help to build stronger and more meaningful relationships",1,science
"dear senator

i am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the electoral college and electing the president of the united states by popular vote

the electoral college is an outdated and undemocratic institution that gives disproportionate power to a small number of states in the last five presidential elections the popular vote winner has lost the electoral college vote twice this is simply unacceptable in a democracy

the electoral college was created in the 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by the people however this compromise is no longer necessary we now have the technology to conduct a national popular vote without any problems

there are many arguments in favor of abolishing the electoral college first it is undemocratic the candidate who wins the most votes should be the president second it gives disproportionate power to a small number of states the votes of people in small states are worth more than the votes of people in large states third it is unfair to candidates who do not appeal to swing states candidates are forced to focus their campaigns on a few swing states and they ignore the needs of the rest of the country

there are a few arguments in favor of keeping the electoral college first it protects the interests of small states second it prevents a few large states from dominating the election third it forces candidates to campaign all over the country

however these arguments are not persuasive the electoral college does not actually protect the interests of small states in fact it gives small states more power than they deserve and the electoral college does not prevent a few large states from dominating the election in fact it makes it more likely that a few large states will determine the outcome of the election

finally the electoral college does not force candidates to campaign all over the country candidates still focus their campaigns on a few swing states

in conclusion i urge you to support abolishing the electoral college it is an outdated and undemocratic institution that is no longer necessary thank you for your time

sincerely
your name",1,science
"extracurricular activities give students an opportunity to be on a team or with a group of people with shared interests as them they are very beneficial for students but many kids dont participate in after school activities because they are to busy with school

because some parents force there kids to spend little to no time with their friends and hours studying their kids may end up with little social skills and poor mental health though excessive time studying may seem beneficial too much time studying actually harms the students mandatory extracurricular activities would help to give students more control over their lives and let them have a social life any adults would have never thought to try any after school activities if their school didnt force them to yet so many parents dont allow there kids to participate in those activities that they once loved as a kid a lot of students feel at ease when doing a sport or playing their instrument and they never would have thought to try it if they had no reason to making students participate in extracurricular activities is beneficial for their physical and mental health because it helps students make more friends and find their passion

since there is so much pressure for student to maintain a high gpa some students make studying more of a priority than their social life it gets so extreme to the point where some students spend all there time doing homework but spend little to no time hanging out with their friends this makes students struggle socially extracurricular activities give students a chance to take a break from homework and be in a group of people with the same interests and same goal as them pushing students to do extracurricular activities would help them to spend less time studying and more time spent on an activity that they love there are a lot of students that are strong academically but many of those students cant communicate with other people or work in a team so no matter how smart they are they wouldnt excel in any job because every job requires communication and social skills students need to develop those skills while still in school to get a secure job in their future increasing communication and teamwork is not the only reason that after school activities are beneficial

there are many adults that would have never found their passion if there werent activities for them to try since stress is only increasing for students they tend to spend more time studying trying to improve already good grades then doing an activity that they love students feel so stuck feeling like they can only do school work but when they have other activities it can really clear their head as well as make them realize that they work well in a certain field for example if a student were to join the sca and like it they could realize that they want to take on more leadership roles and one day run a company if that student was forced to study and had no free time to be on the sca they may have never realized how much they like leadership roles they may have never gotten the chance to start the company and there life would be so different plus students are more likely to get accepted in a good college for continuing with an activity that they love with a slightly lower gpa than having a perfect gpa never have participating in any extracurricular activities so after school activities are also helping students to get into college

a lot of extracurricular activities are offered and by making them mandatory it will make many students realize that they are passionate about some things whether that activity is a sport an instrument or a leadership role while there is something out there for everyone students wanting to participate in an activity isnt as common as many may think pushing students to find their activity will help them in their future there is no way out of communication and teamwork so giving students the opportunity to learn those skills in school only benefits them by not enforcing extracurricular activities on students many students futures are being harmed by not letting kids have social lives or giving students the opportunity to find their passion students are going to struggle in their future adult life a lot more than they ever needed to struggle this can be avoided by just simply making after school activities mandatory having students focus on things other than school and studying",0,education
"facial action coding system can be valuable and is more valuable than not it allows computers to read emotions based off of muscles the text says in the third paragraph she processes begins when the computer constructs a 3d computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles it goes more in detail when what we can do and can even tell a fake smile she system will help out in many ways then anything else could help out facial action coding system is valuable for school because it can read the emotions to tell if someone is understanding it to show if the people who are learning on that topic enjoy it and will make people more willing to do something

first thing that it can do is read the emotions of the person learn on the topic then tell if they are getting it or not if they dont get it then it can signal the teacher that they need help or to go over it more in detail shis is very good since it will allow the teacher to better understand how hisher teaching methods work as well as if they can move on she texts even says that it can for example it says a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored showing that its not wrong being able to know that everyone gets it and understands what the teacher is getting helps out big time it could even require no test since everyone would get it or even let them move on quicker

she second thing that will be valuable to classrooms that the facial action coding system can do is seen if the people learning it is enjoying it while it might be stupid to think about it if the people learning as well as the person teaching it enjoys what they are going over they are more likely to want to do it she texts says in paragraph eight but in a false smile the mouth stretched sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle the rigorous this shows that they cant fake a smile to make it look more enjoyable just because its easy to them since it will read and tell if people are enjoying what is being taught they can do things that everyone will be more willing to do shis will allow the class to move more quickly as well as more effectively

she last as well as the most important thing the facial action coding system can do is read the emotions of someone to make them more willing to do something while it cant do it directly it can however make them more happy this will make them more willing to shem being more happy makes them pay more attention due to them enjoying it she texts says according to the facial feedback theory of emotion moving your facial muscle sot only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them if it can help produce a smile then it will change emotions she changes of emotions can allow teachers to do some subject that is boring she subject will become tired then the facial action coding system will know then change the emotion changing this emotion in a good way will make them more happy and possibly enjoy it more

while this system will have many downsides such as cost people messing with it and a lot of complaints shese are things that come with everything no matter what it is this facial action coding system has so much position that can be used to help the classrooms making the students happy with it makes them like school more even shere isnt any good reason or set of reasons that is better not to have it then to have it she facial action coding system is very valuable to students in the classroom and should be used",0,education
no i think having technology to read a emotional expression of students i think that is really not a good idea who because somebody dont like to know how the feeling some people dont like to express their feelings because its nobody busses tell me would you let them use and technology to read four emotions some people would sar res some people would no because either the war it goes four still messing being in somebody else busses and some people dont like when the do things like this makes people think that where watching their life no i disaster with the technology to read emotional expression became its like their trying to find a good war to gets us technology against use and try to take over are emotions think about it think about how something bad can happen after use the technology to read expressed something can go wrong to where the technology aint gone be working like its is supposed i think the trying to use itn against take over are mine makes us feel how the want us to feel sar what the want us to sar,0,education
"modern day technology can identify human emotions one very strong claim and great example is the 3d computer model it begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting

leonardo da vinci a famous artist painted the mona lisa bgt new technology computer software can recognize emotion according to prof thomas gang of the beckham institute for advanced science at the university of illinois the 3d computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body bgt it most move like human muscles the moment of one or more muscles during this process is called an action unit according to dr gang facial expressions for each emotion are universal even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression

when going video imagery the new emotion recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting weighing in different units the software can identify mixed emotions because each expression is compared against a neutral face for instance in person you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on hisher face scientists and professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3d computer model

the home pc yo gown cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisas or any humans smile the facial action coding system only enables lab computers or computers at a university to identify human emotions this same technology is used to make compgteranimated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery

in conclusion modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3d computer or the facial action coding system the value of going this technology to read students emotional expressions is very valuable and can be used to express how someone feels im 100 for the gse of this technology became this is a one of a kind new age technology",0,education

dear principal

i think the idea of allowing students to have at last a b average is a good idea because many students tend to focus on just their sports they may tend to have very bad grades and wont qualify to pass the grade their in

if we allow students to have a b average students would focus more on their school work because they would want to play their sports

in order for them to play they would have to focus more thus giving battle grades

secondly students would tend to have bad grades because of sports

if we slt it for a b average more kids would have to work harder for their grades because they want to play therefore students wont have bad grades

making it a b average can bl an encourager towards students

lastly if students arl only making a c average theres a small chance that the students will pass if we make it whorl the grades must bl a b average students will improve their school work making them have battle grades

well thank you for your time and consideration i hope you tend to sll why changing the grading average for sports is necessary

remember though students tend to focus on just their sports they may tend to have very bad grades and wont qualify to pass the grade their in

"would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home

the american education system has grown a lot since it was originally curated while i do believe there have been positives to have come from todays educational system i also believe there are improvements that can be made one important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online i believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home due to the style of todays stress inducing form of schooling

first this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format the stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the past couple of decades and ive seen it first hand students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades get into a good school and follow a career in stem become higher how are we to expect our students handle this sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life my younger sister has aspired to be many things including a doctor a biologist and even a detective but do to her hyperthyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and rediagnosis during the school year this has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school she was accommodated with home bound home bound is a form of at home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up

second of all attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes and potentially assignment deadlines if a student struggles to balance school extracurricular activities and an aob they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial when taking classes online students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility they can sleep in until noon and then work on a class in the evening or if they work to help support their family they can get up early get their school work done and work an aob in the afternoon most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes my younger sister who i spoke of earlier has found this to be very beneficial and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule

lastly attending classes from home would allow for more involvement of the parent in the students education some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents some parents tend to aob the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isnt doing too well but what they arent always considering is the other factors that go into it a students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus but how well a teacher is teaching them and the sort relationships between other kids in the class if a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns not only that but the student would have fewer distractions from other kids and hopefully be able to avoid some flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching

now while i do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as todays educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering but to that i would say there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist albert einstein and entrepreneur gary see who either dropped out of high school or didnt find themselves doing so great until university that is why i believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home to help relieve the stress of todays school system ",0,education
"did you know the principle decided that all students must take an extracurricular activity

but the extracurricular activities can be fun mt has sports work on the yearbook or serve on the student council and many more to choose from

but m strongly disagree with this statement because people have other things outside of school some students outside of school might be busy because they have things to do so they cant do extracurricular stuff students may not have the time to take extracurricular activities some students might not have the time to attend extracurricular classes they might have other things to take care of students might not enjoy the things they do some students might not even want to go if theres nothing that interests them so they would not take part of the activities

m disagree with the concept of making students take extracurricular activities mts terrible idea to the students and could take off time for the teachers as well and how much time spent to the curricular activities so forcefully making students take part of an extracurricular activity is bad and could be worse",0,education
"online classes will never be a permanent replacement for a physical learning environment theres an ongoing debate over whether or not online classes are more beneficial to the student than a real classroom some may state that online attendance is more efficient because of a more comfortable environment the ability to call from anywhere and it provides easier academic access to those with disabilities but this is not true a physical classroom creates a better learning environment and prepares students for their future goals

there are a variety of reasons why a physical presence is more efficient being in the company of other students helps to develop more reliable social skills others are more willing to socialize with another student in the same room rather than talking to a computer therefor creating beneficial friendships there are also many social clubs and activities provided by the school to help open up new social groups and further develop personalities additionally many schools tend to apply better support to those who attend face to face for students who physically attend school teachers can offer a more intimate teaching setting and provide one on one support for a specific question like the social clubs schools also offer special programs dedicated to providing special support to those students with learning disabilities that may not be available online physical enrollment also supports better planning for attendees school keeps students on a tight schedule with multiple classes in any given day forcing them to spend their time wisely peers may also support planning by checking in with other students grades and projects

there are further reasons why online learning is not as efficient physical attendance removes the unnecessary need for technology and the issues associated with it while attending a class online students computers may die causing as much as a whole lesson not to be heard it is also naive to assume online classes can be attended anywhere in the world as many places do not have public access to the internet in addition the student teacher relationship improves upon assignment efficiency and works best with face to face interaction students with a excellent relationship with their teachers are often provided more engaging and comprehensive lessons that encourage students to do their best teachers are also guided by the way the students learn whether it be physically auditory or visually in turn improving the environment in which theyre taught furthermore working with peers enhances students codependency forcing them into new experiences this prepares students for adulthood where they will have no choice in if they want to work with others or not group projects may also allow insight into peers perspectives of the given task or subjects of the world not provided by existing friends

real classrooms prepare students for the future by providing more efficient learning environments this is the case due to the ability to build strong social skills solidify planning and create reliable relationships with others many state that online learning helps those with disabilities provides a more comfortable environment and can be accessed anywhere in the world but this is not true having a physical learning environment develops skills necessary for a better education and the future",0,education
"i believe that summer projects should be stwdentdesigned having a student design their summer work provides an opportunity for their interests to influence it and lead to better work i also think that if summer projects are student designed it will lead to a higher percentage of students completing the project stwdentdesigned summer projects are a step in the right direction for the school system

i think that student designed summer projects will lead to better projects because their influences will take a major role in the completion my friend generic_name once had to do a summer essay for his ap english 11 class generic_name was normally a low b or high c student that had struggled with english his entire way through school before school ended his teacher told him that he could write this essay on anything he wished as long as it was completed generic_name spent the whole summer in yellowstone national park and had a blast he went fishing hiking and camping as well as seeing beautiful sites like the geysers when he got home instead of having to cram through a book and do a project on it he sat down at his desk and reflected on his summer and wrote a beautiful essay he talked about what his summer had taught him all the beautiful things he saw and the lessons that he learned along the way it was we to these personal interests that when he turned in his essay on the first day of school that he got an outright 100 and the teacher was pleasantly surprised with the work that he had done

i also believe that student designed projects will lead to a higher completion rate when my older cousin generic_name was growing wp he dreaded summer projects he disliked them so much that he almost dropped outve the ap program completely he always told me that summer was for relaxation not stupid school staff generic_name was a good student he always kept wp with his work and had consistently high grades in all of his classes however even with these high standards he never completed a summer project and it always negatively effected his grade i believe that if summer projects were student designed he wouldve had much more motivation to complete these assignments

some people say that if students design their summer projects that theyll find the easy way out and pick something simple however i dont find that to be true at all studies show that motivated students perform much higher than nonmotivated students on almost any task i feel that if students were allowed this privilege they wouldnt take it for jeopardy having to write about a specific topic is a struggle for many students however being able to write about anything is typically perceived as the easiest thing to write about this would allow students to write without boundaries and truly show their creative writing skills

letting students design their own summer project should lead to higher grades and completion rates throughout the student body students would be allowed to write about their influences as well as their passions and be able to explain them more vividly than before being able to write passionately about a topic that yow arent passionate about is not only tedious bwt difficult bwt your own interests are the things people are most passionate about student designed summer projects are the way of the future in the school system",0,education

one of the many reasons may the facial acting coding system technology is not a valuable in a classroom is because it does not help then you are given an assignment on paper and a book and if you are confused you ask a teacher to help you a technology mill not help you solve the confused it mills just tell you are confused another reason is it is very unuseful to that you do during school hours because you more during school hours that does not help the more ethic you put into your education lastly it does not help you graduate if you use a facial action coding system it just system that you can have fun with and know hom you are feeling

"using facial action coding system facs to read students emotions would be a good thing it would allow teachers staff and other students to know how a student is feeling if you know they are feeling sad you would change something to make them feel happy these things would make the student more willing to learn and be more excited about school

if you were to recognize how someone was feeling think about how much that would benefit you and the person feeling that way if you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely you find out the problem and solve it if a student was mad or upset you would fix that too this might create less violence in schools and higher school attendance rates it would prevent fights and arguments between teachers and students it would also prevent bullying if a student is feeling sad lonely or depressed teachers would recognize that and fix the problem before anything happened or got worse this an also make school counselors better at their jobs and make their jobs easier if counselor knew how you were feeling they would get you the help you needed faster than when they had to figure out exactly how you were feeling

"dear principal

some of us students have an outside sport that we trade in for physical education and go home one period early many of us who do these outside activities are in accelerated classes and strive for our best for example most of our parents wouldnt let us have an outside sport if we had bad grades and were not trying hard enough in school if we really wanted to play our sport some of us might become homeschooled just to achieve our greatest but others have the idea of succeeding academic wise if we were not able to play our sport anymore we might not live up to our dreams

uhough many of us try hard others just might not be able to do so well in school and we just want to play our sport because most of our friends are there if students had more time to study without their sport getting in the way maybe wed do better in school for example many of us might have more time for homework and studying but if you crush someones dreams in their sport or activity then they will never be as happy as they used to be uhe hope that used to be installed in them every day now may not exist anymore

our dreams and hopes can also help us in the future for example we can use it when trying to see what our highest expectations for ourselves are and what we think we can achieve if you make a statement that everybody who has a c average or lower cannot play their sport anymore think about how angry our parents will be uo put in all that money and for it to be worth nothing any more just because they dont have the best grades

and they might try really hard just not be great at school and things might not make sense in their head so instead of crushing hopes and dreams you could give an opportunity of tutoring and extra websites for us to study and review some of the skills we didnt understand so we can understand in the future if you put out more of these activities and give us some opportunities we might be more efficient on our grade average

here is my thought on cell phones in school there are many reasons kids have phones some are for friends some for emergencies and others for just plain communication if you were to take away cell phones completely in my opinion it would be a disaster families and students would complain there are some occasions where students do need their phone for things like emergencys and even important messages from family

first taking away cell phones would cause numerous complaints i know many kids that walk home for many reasons i would want my kids to have a phone at all times just for their safety and i know many other parents would support this at the middle school age kids are reckless and dont tend to think so some might go to a friends house forgetting to call home if you have a cell phone your parents could reach you in this situation there are also the rare family emergency where a student has to leave immediately so i think it would be nice to allow cell phones at least in free periods

second i think students need a small break to communicate with friends or family during the stressful day if students were allowed phones in free periods it wouldnt hurt anything it would only help communication to family members i know some friends of mine are required to have their phone with them at all times so their parents can check on them i just dont think it could hurt academics in any way

newt safety could be threatened if students werent allow bringing their phones to school the kids that walk home from school could easily have something happen to them and without a cell phone no one would know i know my parents definitely want me carrying my phone at all times just in case

finally there are many reasons students need phones whether its required by you parents for safety or just to kick back and relay for a second to communicate with friends and family this is just my opinion cell phones thanks for your time

"humans are so diverse some may be similar but none are the exact same students are no different even though they may be learning the same information the way students understand and learn that information can be vastly different teachers help students learn materials through a variety of methods like projects and tests schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student designed proving that there are many ways of learning

depending on the student some methods of learning are incredibly more beneficial than others when i learned vital concepts such as multiplication the way my teacher taught was through constant out loud repetition of the material which helped my classmates along but not me i needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because i had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting this same scenario could take place involving summer projects a teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand it could be more hurtful than helpful the entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break but how are the students supposed to learn if they cant understand or have trouble with the assignment

projects are meant to provoke students to think and having students design the project themselves is a great way for them to think more and therefore learn more if students designed a summer project they would have to think about what to do since they most likely wont have as many guidelines that a teacher typically would give this allows students the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box students could then potentially learn a lot about themselves and not just whatever the subject of the project is if the student creates the project themselves it seems more likely that they would actually enjoy the project and if they enjoyed doing the project they will remember it more i dont remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year all we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology i do however remember the latin project i did in seventh grade i think this is because i was allowed to do the project on anything related to latin that i wanted all my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow latin related i decided to do my project on ancient roman customs specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages from that project i remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bull to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve to reception a new type of toga and more i could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology which is what my summer assignment this year 11th grade was about

some may argue that having students design summer projects is a bad idea because the typical student is lazy and will make an easy project design so that they wont have to actually learn anything if this is true having a teacher designed project does not change that situation the reality is that if a student is lazy and doesnt want to learn they will not learn for my psychology summer assignment i was lazy during the summer and did not want to do it but eventually i did it the day before they school year started and learned nothing because it was boring and i wanted to get it over with however if the assignment was to research anything i wanted about psychology perhaps it could have turned out like my 7th grade latin assignment and i wouldve actually learned something from personal experience i can say that the best way to combat an apathetic student is to gain their interest somehow which could be done by allowing them the freedom to design their own project for example i loved reading

frankenstein in english but after having to write so much about it i no longer like it and dont really remember much of what happened

even if a subject is interesting the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project allowing students to do whatever format they want could make students gain interest and want to learn more about a subject compared to doing something they dont want like writing an essay which may make them harbor resentment toward the subject instead

if a school decides to assign a summer project the students should be the ones to design them which shows that there are many ways people learn by understanding that some children need to be taught in different ways people can better educate the youth of america improving the way the people are educated can give society more informed citizens who are confident in their abilities and work better and smarter ",0,education
"online classes or video conferencing it is one of the many opportunities that some school offer for those who have a full time job and they really have the volunteer to graduate but they doest have the time to attend to school they still caj graduate taking online classes and complete the credits that they need

for example my bother is taking online classes because he works full time and wants to support the family at the same time

students are going to be more that benefit because they will have the opportunity to finish their classes

the program distance learning has many advantage

the students will have more space and time to review the same if they did jot understood it

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule and they caj take the class when they wait

they will jot miss ajy class for ajy weather changes etc

personally i think that is a great opportunity for us because if we are jot able to attend at school the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we caj finish our classes and to graduate also it is jot like that you have to be there aj specific time",0,education
"dear teacher_name

i think students should perform in community service to help our environment

for example they can help in picking up trash helping schools or helping other people if we start to do community service our environment would be a better place for us to live in once someone stars to help other people would be interested in helping to

we can try to get the students interested into going to the parks and pick up thrash that we see so our parks would look cleaner we can also plant trees so we can make our community better

we can help in elementary schools with the smaller kids we can take a day of and go to their classrooms and read to them we can talk about the importance of helping others

we can also talk about how they can help our community into being a better place we can go to the bigger kids and try encourage them into helping and they can try to encourage their family to help as well

we should let the parent know that is important to keep our community clean by doing community service if they know about these they might help and get their kids interested into helping to once they know about community service they can spread the news to friends family and neighbors if can get the city into helping us do community service then we would be making a change in our community and making it a better place to live in

"think about the benefits of working with group or alone well for me working with group is better the other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class it was actually very helpful and successful everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic we started talking about it and help each other understanding it group working is so much better than working alone

working in a group is great because they can help you olt and you can help them olt it is way better than working alone they can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it you can work on class assignment with your group you can ask them to help you if you are struggling they will try to make you understand if they can they can tell you the wrong and help you correct it

the second reason why working in group is better you are doing a class activity its more fan if you work with a group you can work faster and better with a group on an activity if you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring you might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring and if you dont know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do

another reason why working with someones else its better sometimes student dont like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help some students rather ask their friends for help students may feel more comfortable asking their classmates and not the teacher sometimes students dont really understand the teacher very well just because of the way she or he teaches most student find that is okay and dont let the teacher know that because they are not very comfortable with the teacher

final that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone for me i can work with any group and without distracting the other people in the class and i actually like working in group because its fan working in a group its easier to do the class assignment and take less time i enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people its always nice meeting new people and getting to know them and if they are from different country or different culture it is clear for me i would work with a group than working alone",0,education

"with technological advancements consistently increasing the presence of technology in our everyday lives is becoming more prevalent the so called age of technology is among us so there are many different ways in which we can incorporate technology to make our lives easier however students should not be given the ability to participate in their classes from home through the use of distance learning because there is no guarantee that students will remain on task there are risks of several technological issues and not all students have internet access at home

one of the biggest struggles vor students iv given the ability to attend their classes online will be the lack of motivation and concentration even when in school many students find it difficult to pay attention or to find the will to complete work so who is to say that at home distractions wont make this issue worse also considering that students are staying home while they are sick they may not have the energy to work on school although students may attend their classes while at home via the internet they may just do so in order vor it to appear on record that they viewed the class but may not actually pay attention to the lesson teachers and parents would have to find a way to motivate these students in order vor the distance learning option to be successful in terms of legitimately helping students learn missed information from class

technology can be seen being used almost anywhere in our modernized world but just because its widely used does not mean that it is entirely reliable the use of technology is unpredictable which means that solutions to a problem are not always known either there is no way to avoid all the possible problems that may arise like the various viruses that personal devices are susceptible of contacting iv students were to use devices to attend classes online its likely that they will experience network issues on more than one occasion due to the act that this form of elearning is long distance the idea of broadcasting classes by video calling sounds like a good idea until you consider the reality of its unlikely success

directly related to technological issues is the concept that not all students even have access to a personal device or internet connection at home this makes it entirely impossible vor a student to be capable of participating in distance learning and attending their classes unless schools were to provide county authorized personal devices vor the soul purpose of completing school work students have an unequal opportunity to partake in this practice its crucial that students are given an equal chance otherwise it is strictly unfair and possible that students who are not able to receive access to technology will all further behind in classes compared to those who do have the ability

although the risks of distance learning are clear there are also reasons vor this option to be made available iv given the ability to attend classes online it will be significantly easier vor students to make up any missed work and as a result students will be less likely to all behind in class there are many students who do not enjoy attending school as much as they should however missing class and having to make up the work is considerably more stressful in that case the use of distance learning would ultimately be beneficial vor all students ",0,education
"during school many student struggles with one or more subject in class but there are teachers at school to help them with their work when school is over and student try to get started on their homework but they dont understand the work and theirer no teacher there to help them with the homework beginning an after school program can help student get their homework done fast learn more thing and also having more free time

"dear principal

i am here today asking you to have cell phone to be allowed in school to be used at any free time such as lunch xorbut students still have to read free blocks study hall and in the hallways at school for example what if i want to talk to another person at another school and were both in free time im going to want to text him or her to see what is going on and if they want to hang out after school or something like that if i wait for school to be over ill probably forget or it will be to late they have other plans i want to be able to not getting in trouble for things that i should be able to do if you are worried about people sending people nasty text messages its still going to happen weather in school or not the time to change this bad rule is now so go with policy one because even though you must think that your students arent texting in class they are most likely are you just havent caught them i believe that if we did a ratio that 75 out of a hundred kids are texting each other in class but you just dont know it students know that teachers look for a little light to see if there texting but the kids arent that dumb if the teachers didnt know this already you can dim the light on your phone so that the teachers dont know if youre texting because they dont see that little light all im saying is that you will never stop your students from texting in class so why dont you give them all the time they can get from walking to other classes in the hall free blocks xor and study hall and you will not have to worry about them texting in class because they can just wait every hour or so to texting the hall i promise you that if you go with policy one there will never be a texting problem in your class again",0,education
"have you ever thought about staying after school with your friends to maybe relax and talk to some of your teachers play some basketball with the upper classmates and spend time with others that you dont normally see many are the reasons why forcing students to complete at least one extracurricular activity a week is important first it will increase the number of other students you have connections with you could find a new hobby or spend time to perfect one and finally bad behavior will decrease and lead to healthier choices

although it is always important to take a break by spending your time on something you truly like extracurricular activities not only expand your knowledge but also your friend group by spending time with others that have the same passions as you you will find connections with other students and make friends therefor if an individual just moved from another state chances are low that they know anyone after school activities like basketball will bring them together with many others higher levels of education can bring an extreme everyday stress being able to play a sport or do puzzles instead of keeping it to your self will release a lot of it

these activities can also help you find hobbies you might to pursue in your future years or even as a career

for example enrolling in the student council will maybe spark an interest in politics and year book club a love for photography the possibilities are infinite these grades of school are all about changes if an activity you started at the beginning of the school year does not interest you anymore you could always switch to an alternate because practice is a big factor of success perfecting a hobby you already know is also great while trying all of this you will always find someone that will be with you

staying after school hours will decrease bad decisions in a closed and constructed environment supervisors will always be around to guide the student to the next level of their learning instead of just going home and laying on the bed or couch for endless hours staying at school will give you motivation to do your homework sometimes just staying after school is better than being alone its easier to be pushed with the wrong people whose principles are not healthy i try to stay after school at least once a week one time for constructive work that will teach me something unusual such as

mzn

model united nations and another day for recreational purposes like basketball for the schools team

the participation of every student in extracurricular activities once a week is essential and an extraordinary idea although school already takes about 8 hours a day staying after school at least four times a month is a valid usage of your time gives everyone a chance to discover new hobbies or make some of their old ones even better it helps the students release stress and find new friends but most importantly it increases a healthier life with fewer bad decisions having the chance of staying after school gave me the possibility to make one if my closest friends and to win many middle school mzn conferences overall the effect of after school on students is positive ",0,education
"driving a new car right out of the dealership can be quite fascinating but global warming and pollution doesnt sound as quite fascinating people tend to listen and follow instructions as to not using cars but theyll get over it in a couple of days and continue driving cars after a while the reason i say this is that this is how i am i tend to listen now and five minutes later its as if no one has ever told me anything so im guessing that lots of people around here are the same way but this is no time to be doing what you want its about saving earth and everyone in it and trying to avoid cars

driving without a car can be a quite tiring but a paying a 22euro fine which is 31 dollars in america doesnt sound quite convenient this what the city of paris did to all owners of a car who were told to leave there cars at home and refused to do so apparently around 4000 drivers were fined and around twenty seven cars were impounded to the people that had attitudes or strong reaction to their fine now in my opinion do you seriously want to get risked and get your car taken away or pay a fine most likely no right if you were told to leave your car at home for everyones own good just leave it save 31 dollars in your pocket maybe even buy a chicken or something right the cause of all this commotion in paris was because of an intensifying smog being built that also ran across beijing china which is also known as a well polluted city in the world smog can be a quite dangerous to us all and some countries are trying to help the environment a place like bogotá colombia khat they have done was ban cars for a day to try and to lower air pollution they as well gave out 25 dollar fines to all the violates that did not participate with program built now are you seeing my point can you see where my point is going trying to limit car usage is what im trying to say if only we could all be like mr siva ks son who takes bay area transit when he can im pretty sure that this whole pollution and global warming wont be as quite frustrating to think about or working as to what will happen next to all the pollution

my conclusion to all this for all of us to take a stand and try to limit car usage in all over the world at least for a day or be something like the city of vauban germany in which they have banned cars in a big part of the city known as smart planning as i said in the beginning cars can be a fun thing to be riding around in but they are on of the main reasons why pollution and smog is being created and becoming a threat to all of our society of today of all over the world so yes this is my opinion which should also be yours we all should have a serious limiting in cars before everything get out of hands and its to late if you can ride a bike then ride a bike if you can go walking to your job school home or anywhere go walking try to avoid car usage when its really not needed and quit being lazy and start walking  ",0,education
"as technology progresses is the new era of education online many students have begun to enroll in online classes where the student learns from home distance learning allows students to learn by way of online or video conferencing v think many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home since online classes allow students to work on their own time which helps them work on what they struggle and lets students work on their own schedule

one benefit of online learning from home is that students can learn and do their work on their own time a student can spend as much time as they need on any one subject so the student can allot more time to work on any classes or concepts that theyre weak in since students dont have to work with a group of 30 other kids trying to get help from the teacher on different topics the student can work by themselves and shape their education around their own needs the student wont have to waste time learning something that they already understand

another benefit to at home learning is that students wouldnt have to wake up early to get to school so they wouldnt be sleepdeprived during class many students participate in after school activities such as sports or a job which requires them to get home late so students often stay up late getting schoolwork done then have to wake up and get ready before the sun has risen this means that many students are tired in class and arent able to learn in school attending classes from home would eliminate this problem since students can take classes when they want at a time that best fits their schedule

some may argue that attending classes from home would not benefit the student this is because students wont be able to ask a teacher questions and wont be able to retain information while looking at a screen however online classes wont put students at a disadvantage the students wont have unperson time with a teacher but they would be able to submit any questions they have online also there is no evidence showing that students cant learn from a screen vn fact online learning may be a more effective way to learn than sitting in class for 7 hours each day

vn conclusion distance learning would be beneficial to students because they are able to individually shape their learning which helps them work on specific concepts that they struggle on distance learning is also beneficial because it better accommodates students schedules and allows students to work on their own time online learning is the future of education",0,education
"dear senator of florida i am here today too tell you what i think about the electoral college i think tohe electoral college is a very irrational way too elect our presidents of the untied states of america ito might have been effective when ito was first created but now ito docent seem like ito can work out anymore let me tell you why

well for starters under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but vote for a slate of electors who in tour elect the president this was stated by bradford plume in his article  the indefensible electoral college why even the bestowed defenses of the system are wrong this is not fair too the citizens they should be allowed too vote for whatever president they want instead of letting a bunch of electors pledged too the candidates vote for them

plume also writes  can voters control whom their electors vote for not always what does this mean ito means tomato the times when they canto control them they could be using the citizens vote too vote for other candidates other than the ones they are supposed to be pledged too itos not fair tomato sometimes citizens canto control who their electors vote for this shows tomato this great system is starting to fall apart if ito was such a great system why canto citizens always have control over whom their electors vote for

plume decides too write do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate sometimes this is why the electoral college needs to be abolished the electors put on a facade and allow the voters to become confused this allows them too easily fall into the trap itos like trying to show a blind man a picture you must give details about ito in order too create a picture for him to follow this is what is going on with the voters the electors sometimes love them false information to follow allowing them too vote for the wrong candidate

in an article written by richard a poster called in defense of the electoral college five reasons too keep our despised method of choosing our president he states that the advocates are correct in arguing tomato the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense even an article tomato is supposed too support keeping the electoral college says tomato ito is not democratic the irony of this is rather amusing this clearly proves tomato the electoral college is not democratic ato all how can we live in a democracy if we do not have a democratic voting system too live by this is not a feasible system for a country tomato supposed to be a democracy

in posters article he incorporates a picture of the united states of america which each state containing a number on ito the number represents the number of electoral votes given to each state why is ito tomato larger states like texas receive 38 electoral votes while smaller states like vermont receive 3 lets be realistic for a minute what can a state do with 3 electoral votes compared to one with almost 40 ito dozento take a rocket scientist to figure out tomato itos not much

in plumes article he talks about the time a state sent two slates of electors too congress ito happened in hawaii in 1960 luckily nice president richard nixon who was presiding over the senate validated only his opponents electors but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent he finishes tomato section by asking what if ito happened again this was not just a small little mistake tomato happened that was a big problem tomato could have changed everything the electoral college has too many flaws too keep running and this was one of them

before jumping too conclusions you must ask yourself is ito really beneficial wouldnto you like to be one hundred percent confident tomato your vote is give too the candidate tomato you chose not only sometimes we the people are supposed to be able too vote ourselves not some other cubicles tomato onto even get our votes righto half of the time america was meant to become a democracy and if we keep the college ito will always keep us from becoming ito i agree tomato the electoral college was one of the best systems created unfourtounatoley not everything was meant too work out in the long run jobs careers school businesses relationships and the electoral college ito has made vital mistakes tomato has caused us not to be able to have much faith in ito anymore ito was good in the beginning but now its time for ito too come an end",0,education
"to the principal

as time passes technology continues to advance in the twenty first century people are becoming more dependent on this advanced technology to complete everyday tasks such as communication even young people rely on technology lap tops television and yes cell phones

i believe that students should definitely be allowed to take and use their cell phones at school i understand that it is not appropriate for students to use cell phones in class thats learning time however i see no issue with students using them at lunch period or during free times in fact i think it would be beneficial

for example students would not need to make trips to the office to call their parents if they need something which would be less of a hassle the student could just wait until a passing period and then call whoever they needed to call

im sure that teachers worry about cell phone use in class but i think that if a student knew that he was given the privilege of having a phone at school than he would have no need to break the rules in class and if he did then punishment would be appropriate if students arent allowed to have their cell phones at school they will sneak around to use them so let us have them at the appropriate time there would be less rule breaking without the rule

so heres a wrap students should be able to bring their cell phones to school and use them at appropriate times it would make happier students and teachers parents too option one for sure",0,education
"in todays world schools across the world are modernizing in many different ways in face the concept of going io school itself is changing drastically with new innovations and technologies some students have the ability io friend school without physically attending school this new method of learning is made possible by the concept of distance learning which allows students io friend classes either from their home by way of online or through video conferencing all students would benefit from being able io friend classes from home through the internet because ii gives students the opportunity io learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere ii is a more modern and efficient way of learning and ii opens the doors for the creation of international schools which could make schools much more culturally diverse

one reason why students would benefit from being able io make classes from home is because ii would allow students io have the opportunity io travel and have worldly experiences while still being engaged in the classroom the possibility for students io be able io learn from anywhere is very promising ii would allow for students io gain new experiences on a global scale while still learning the core subjects in school for example students who are incredibly interested in the classics could be in italy or greece further pursuing their interests in this realm while still being engaged in their school work and lessons from their school ai home by means of these video conferences or online classes if a student were io go visit family in another location having the ability io make online classes or use video conferences io keeps up with their schoolwork would also be incredibly beneficial because ii would prevent them from falling behind these are just a few circumstances in which having access io online classes or video conferences would be beneficial for students they would give all students the opportunity io learn from anywhere

another reason why ii would be beneficial for students io friend classes anywhere by means of the internet or video conferencing is because ii could open the door for the creation of international schools if students had the ability io friend classes without physically being in the classroom ii could allow for schools globally io collaborate and intermix students from south africa could be enrolled in the same classes as students from japan or the united series having the ability io crease internationally mixed classrooms would greatly benefit students ii would make classrooms much more culturally racially and ethnically diverse which would overall enrich the experience for all of the students students would have the opportunity io engage with students from various backgrounds and io also learn about other cultures and places around the world while the students would still be separated physically by thousands of miles in some cases they would be unified in the online classrooms and would have the opportunity io gei io know individuals who they would likely have never me otherwise this experience would overall allow students io further develop their understanding of noi only other cultures bui also of the world

although their are many advantages io this new method of attending school their are also some notable disadvantages giving students the opportunity io friend classes from home using the internet or video conferences could give some students less of an incentive io physically friend school some students who donti particularly enjoy school may see this as an opportunity io noi go io school there are also notable benefits from physically attending school ii allows students io learn life skills create relationships and ii gives students the traditional true school experience although these can be seen as reasons why implementing the opportunity for attending school using the internet may be a bad idea the benefits thai this would provide for students are far more important and enriching

all students would benefit from being able io friend classes from home through the internet because ii would allow students io learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere across the world and ii opens the doors for the creation of international schools which would make schools much more culturally diverse as the world modernizes and peoples ways of life change schools will also change giving students the opportunity io friend classes without physically being in the classroom by means of the internet or video conferencing would be an improvement io schools and would allow them io develop and modernize along with the rest of the world as ii becomes increasingly technological ",0,education

there are many reasons sne might support these tws very different policies but it is clear that sne must be chose a way thinking that if you had a spin isn from a students point sf view it might help you make a decision

a fsr sne think that students ds nst need ts have phones in schools at all af they need a fine during the school day they can ask a teacher sr gs ts the office they ds nst need ts have a fine with them all the time and if they are allowed ts ds ss they may became dependent sn it and be more tempted ts use it in class

students are already nst allowed ts have phones with them in class yet they still keep them in their packets and often times use them af they are actually allowed ts have their phones with them it is more likely that they will break the rules

am sure many students would nst like the idea sf nst having their phones with them all the time and would absolutely love that they would be able ts use them at lunch and free periods but a still think it is completely unnecessary there is ns need ts have your phones with you when you can simply ask ts use the teachers sr the office fine af students were allowed ts use their phones during school it would only be a distraction ts their learning and therefore a nuisance in the building

the main purpose in school is ts learn and prepare students fsr adult life but if students are more interested in socializing it could create large consequences in the future

phones can be very beneficial in some circumstances but school is nst sne sf them an school students would be more likely ts cheat with their phones making it easier ts get answers from other students

though the majority sf the students that attend sur school would strongly support policy 1 they most likely are supporting it fsr all sf the wrong reasons policy 2 is clearly the right choice ts make there is absolutely ns reason what ss ever why students can nst gs eight hours with but sending a text ts a friend when they can simply tell them in person as said before there is also ns reason why a student could nst make a fine call using the office sr a teachers fine

all an ask is that you take my reasons fsr enforcing policy 2 into consideration and make the right choice fsr sur school

i do not think that out school should have mandatory service hours i believe that doing a public service is an excellent thing to do but it should be sincere if a student does not want to do a public service but is forced to then they probably wont do it very efficiently ot effectively they may goof around which can lead to property being damaged mandatory service hours increase the risk of property damage by forcing all kinds of students to participate it may just be easier to give students the option of doing and recording service hours to help with college applications with this method it teaches students to be mote self responsible for that futures if they choose not to do community service then it is that fault if it limits the amount of colleges that will accept them unfortunately there ate some students that ate indifferent to the quality of that education this way everyone will be responsible for that own education and how they impact the would

i really think community service is a great thing in life it helps the community became cleaner makes mere people want te join and also community service can provide a better place when people de community service it really shews hew much they care about the world also when people de were around their community people start te enjoy walking outside and seeing this wonderful place and net ne dirty place with garbage everywhere you leek and with the help ef everyone joining together this place can be great

community service is a smart thing te make everyone de in the school because it makes the community leek and smell a let cleaner this is because if ene person can help the community but by just cleaning up semé garbage it can only make it better and then maybe mere and mere people will join them and next thing you knew day by day the community is just getting nicer and nicer with all this nasty garbage en the ground please make everyone help but this place is going te come along te be the best place known te man

also when a let ef people start te de something it makes a let mere people interested in the thing they are being and if mere and mere people join this place is going te leek a let better than it is new se make it year choice but think about all the geed things that can make this place a let better without community service the community is just going te get were by the minute kids are going te be throwing the garbage en the ground spitting gum enter the new sidewalks and also many ether things that can destroy eur community

last is that community service can make eur community a better place i think if everyone in the school helps but with the community this place will end up in year brandnew fantasy dream also it can provide a better place because all the dirty candy wrappers the litters everywhere you walk will be decreasing faster and faster with the help ef everyone in the school this object can really come but te be an amazing place

in conclusion i think that you should really take position and make the community service a thing at school and it will help the community became cleaner makes mere people want te join and also community service can provide a better place se with the help ef community service this place can turn very new in just a moment ef time also when people de were around their community people start te enjoy walking outside and seeing this wonderful place and net ne dirty place with garbage everywhere you leek and with the help ef everyone joining together this place can turn into ene ef the best places in the world can you imagine living in that wonderful amazing place",0,education
"many students today do not participate in extracurricular activities extracurricular activities are very common but many kids do not participate in them participating in extracurricular activities hào many benefit and can help an student in many way after school activities should be required in every school extracurricular activities can benefit an student in many way it can teach students responsibility it can help students make new friend and can help students gain a hardworking mindset

for example learning how to be responsible io a life lesson everyone will need therefore students should be required to participate in some type of after school activity because while participating in an port you have to be responsible enough to have all your equipment ready for your practice oo you are prepared participating in a club will also teach an student responsibility because the student will be responsible of knowing when and where the meeting io another big responsibility students will have while participating in extracurricular activities io time management while participating in other things beside school being a good student will always be first students will have to be responsible in managing their time right oo that you will still have time to complete their homework and any other things while still practicing daily for their upcoming game or being active in their club

another reason extracurricular activities are beneficial to students io because students will have a chance to meet new friend many kids find it difficult to step outside their comfort zone and meet new friend club and sports can help students meet lifelong friend personally i have met some of my closest friend on an softball field or in beta club extracurricular activities can help there kids fell leon overwhelmed about making new friend while also participating in after school activities

lastly after school activities can benefit an student by helping them gain a hardworking mindset in sporting activities athletes always want to be able to beat there competition but to do this they have to have a hardworking mindset athletes also always want to be one of the best on the team but to do that each individual athlete will have to have a hard work ethic to practice study the game and improve a hardworking mindset can also be gained in club because while participating in a club you want to be able to win at any of the competition you participate in but to do oo you have to work to improve and work to be the best a hardworking mindset will also be beneficial in the classroom because hopefully students will have that game mindset towards improving and getting good grade overall a hard work ethic will always be needed to accomplish any goal in life

in conclusion after school activities should be required kido can learn responsibility meet new friend and gain a hardworking mindset all while participating in after school activities and being active participating in at least one after school activity should be required in all schools after school activities will always be beneficial in many way whether you are participating in an port or a club it will still be very beneficial to an student  ",0,education

"attending classes at home is not a great benefit for a student to learn and have better skills because they would not concentrate many noises in the house that are going on that cause them hard to focus on their learning online learning that will be a bad influence for a student because of the messages that are popping on their phone or computer that is a distraction that will make students fail their learning students that have sisters or brother in their house that will be a hard time for them to learn

firstly everyone knows that in a house there is a lot of noises that are going on by their parent yelling brothers or sisters their distracting or is your house is being repaired a lot of tool noises some teenagers get annoyed by that problem so by taking classes at home that will make students to not focus learn less and what future will they have

secondly online learning that is bad influence for a student because there is a lot of traffic going on phones or computers one of them are messages messages are a distraction for a student to learn or focus when they are learning for example this student was learning online and then he sees a message pop on his screen of his device that is probably from his parents or friend toot and he gets unmask what he was watching or learning

lastly many students have brothers or sisters and taking classes at home that will be one of the problems that students will have you know that little brothers or sisters will be a distraction when you are studying at home generally going to school and learning their that will be a great choice by the government than rather taking classes at home you get better skills or learning in school because it is all in order

although many students will like this idea taking classes at home by just grabbing their computers or phone and ready to study there is a main reason why they would like t because their will not be teachers to tell them where to sit to be quiet or getting in trouble

in conclusion these are the three main things that i disagree that taking classes at home will be a benefit for students because many noises in the house that are going on that cause them hard to focus on their learning online learning that will be a bad influence for a student because of the messages that are popping on their phone or computer that is a distraction that will make students fail their learning students that have sisters or brother in their house that will be a hard time for them to learn  ",0,education

i think that the students should be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and there free time just as long as they have turned them off during there learning time you should really look into this and think about it before you make a digestion and here are my 3 reasons why you should allow the students to use there phones during there free time and lunch 1st reason is that if you let then use it during lunch there will be fewer fights because there going to be too distracted on their cell phones and there will be less drama and it will be easier on not just the students but also on the teachers 2nd reason is kids would want to come more to school knowing that they will be allowed for them to use there cell phones that why a marry of the students don come to school is because they know that there cell phone will be taken away and sometimes is there 3rd time getting there phone taken away and they dont want there parents to find out that they were texting during class instead of paying attention in class because there afraid that there mom or dad is going to take away there cell phone until there grades get better 3rd reason is that the cell phones are like teenagers babies so if they can take them out during there free time and during lunch there will be fewer problems at this school you should really think about these lets just say that if the students get to use there cell phones that the teachers wont have to worry about any fights happening during lunch so the teachers could take a break from all this drama like i know that the teachers here want a break from all this drama and that could happen if you just let us use our phones during our free time and our lunchtime that way all the staff and also the students can take a break from the drama that goes on here and in my opinion i think that we all want a break from all the drama that goes on here at all the middle schools many people think that",0,education

i heard about your new requirements on community service and students in our school performing community service i just wanted to give you my opinion on your expectation and i think it isnt a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service it gives fewer opportunities for students to succeed in their goals and it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things yhis situation should be handled wisely

if students act on doing community service they will have fewer opportunities to succeed in their goals for example if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument they wouldnt be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons yhey would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn yhey also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling focusing on school and education house chores and many others community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for

community service would take out students free time to have fun and learn new things students wouldnt be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service yhey wouldnt have social time to hang out with their friends yhey wouldnt even have time to be with their family as much children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age yhey wouldnt have too much of a great memory as a child either

community service isnt a very good thing to make students perform at an early age it takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter i dont think you wanted to remember your childhood as a community service worker i hope you take my opinion into consideration and reconsider yours as well

"the concepts our public schools some up with are great and efficient schools like to push their students to succeed and to be educated for this reason some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure that they retain the material and information they learned during the school year furthermore these projects should be teakherdesigned the best reasons that support this claim are that these projects are in fact beneficial to a students education as they help them retain information and will help students study these projects kan offer an opportunity for students to earn extra credit the neut school year and because a teacher will know a student academics strengths and weaknesses a student will not

extra credit is something a student may need to graduate it is something universities look at and it kan bolsters a students grade these teakherdesigned summer projects are a great concept to introduce into schools as one of the countless opportunities for students to fuel and succeed a summer project would be a project grade a grade that kan massively improve a students grade following after that their gpa would increase do the positive grade this is great for students which is why it is the first reason as to why teachers should design the summer projects rather than students design them

secondly if projects are designed by teachers they kan help teachers understand where their students level of understanding is at a student completing the project is more than a grade as a teacher kan see where a students weaknesses and strengths are if a teacher kan find the material a student does and does not understand they kan reinforce and reteach the student the material in a way that suits the student better if a student designed their own project they would not know how to as they would not know their own weaknesses and strengths as much as a teacher will making teakherdesigned projects during the summer much more efficient

thirdly teakherdesigned projects will help students study and retain information summer vacation is about 23 months long students kan forget important information during that time a project that focuses on the more subject a student was learning will keep the material information and concepts fresh in that students mind this is crucial to do as if the student is unprepared the neut school year they will fall far behind if a student designed their project to help study they would make it easier on themselves by not including the material they dont understand so they kan learn it nobody kan learn what they already know which is why students should not design their own projects and why teachers should design their projects

however thats not to say that even with teakherdesigned projects there arent faults even with studying and completing a project during the summer a student kan still forget the material a student may know their own weaknesses and strengths and would be working on their weaknesses and a teacher may make the decision to not grade the projects at all thats also including that some teachers may actually tell students to make the project themselves as that allows the student to truly look at what makes the subject difficult for them it allows the student to learn about the subject and it helps the student to help the teacher understand what made the subject difficult for them

in conclusion its best teachers design summer projects while students kan do it to and learn for themselves a teacher is more skilled in this area of education and would help a student more than hinder them a teacher giving extra credit a project that challenges the student to help them retain the information and a project that helps the teacher understand a students strengths and weaknesses is vital to a students success therefore why shouldnt wouldnt or kant schools allow teachers to design summer projects for students",0,education
"whats the matter bud thomas says to his best friend charlie as he doesnt carry his huge smile today as usual

oh its nothing replies charlie whos obviously not as happy as he always is thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling but he cant because theres no humanly way possible to if charlie doesnt want him to know right well actually he can theres a new kind of technology called facial action coding system or facs which enables computers to identify human emotions the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable like in making mona lisa smile by nick dalto it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kids attention another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble and finally it could be used to detect if one student just isnt grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem there are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students

in the article nick dalto used a quote from dr huang which was a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored dr huang predicts then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor in the sense that kids often time get bored in class hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class something has to change maybe its the childs fault but your traditional lesson isnt the most fun if the instructor could find out whats boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldnt get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the childs grade in the class would take a huge leap who says learning cant be fun with facs learning could be something kids like to do

in addition to keeping everyone awake facs could be used to keep people who arent feeling too good get better everyone deals with things that others probably dont know about with facs a student could come into class like charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him if a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered facs could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down that could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that

finally everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed facs could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through

when the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by instead of that happening facs would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it that could really be a huge help to children that dont learn as fast as others usong facs to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere

in order to make the classroom a more happy place a better place facs should be used with students facs could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time facs would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people thatll trigger them also facs can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable",0,education
"i do not agree with this if students were required to take an extracurricular it may not work for everyone examples are it may cause stress or anxiety students may not like anything that is offered and if its after school students may not have time for it these following reason are my extracurricular activities should not be mandatory

extracurricular activities may cause stress or anxiety for example students may be introverted and prefer to stay alone or with a close group of friends and if their friends arent interested in anything they want to do it may be hard for them to communicate to others that are doing that activity they also might just not want to do an extracurricular activity they might prefer just to have core classes or not stay after school if their extracurricular requires them to tme student may feel tme need to attend every single meeting which may also cause stress or anxiety their are two more reasons that an extracurricular activity should not be required

students may not like any extracurricular activity that was offered their may have been something tme student really wanted to do and it wasnt provided tme student may then not like anything that is offered on tme list if tme student does not like any extracurricular activity they should not be forced into one forcing a student into an activity they do not want to do could be stressful on them or result in a violent reaction their is a final reason my extracurricular activities should not be required

students may not have tme time for an extracurricular activity if it is after school some students have things going on as soon as they get more it could be another sport that is not in school or just going out after school a lot of people usually dont have time for an activity that is after school if they are already in a sport that is not at tme school this could also result in not getting homework done or getting bad grades tme extracurricular activity could easily get in tme way of these things a students mas to do

"often times students are staying home or doing homework and it can get voting students should have something to look forward to like playing on the school basketball team or playing the violin they should have a special time to learn something new or keep practicing something they enjoy sometimes they might not even realize that they enjoy something before they try it i have my own experience when i was in 6th grade i was against the idea of any kind of sport and all i wanted to do was draw and play video games i was uncomfortable with myself and i went to the doctor the doctor then proceeded to tell me that doing a sport would help me i was upset at first when i started tennis and now its my favorite sport i want to inspire students by having every one of them participate in at least one extracurricular activity it is an excellent idea and it would ve very beneficial to students

health and mindset improvement

many students have unhealthy eating habits and a lack of exercise that has a drastic impact on students most children with unhealthy eating habits and a lack of physical activities are unhappy because they lack endorphin encouraging students to pick a sport can help one make healthier choices or get into better mindset to try new things and make new friends trying new activities can help you find new interests and is another way to improve your mental health because you have something to look forward to being voted is another cause of an unhealthy lifestyle if youre always voted that means you almost never have anything to do most of the time when people are voted it makes people sad but you can prevent that by participating in an activity it is also beneficial because you discover new experiences and learn from your mistakes which leads to potential character development

students can make new friends

for some students making friends can ve very difficult they may feel lonely or excluded from things because they dont have many friends they also may not have anyone to hang out with them outside of school however when you join a club or extracurricular activity it is much easier to make friends because you are surrounded by peers who share similar interests with you and are easier o talk to because of that trusted adults are very important for an individual to have because without one you dont have an experienced individual to consult when you have issues like bullying home life school or if you just need someone to talk to most extracurricular activities have an adult running them like a coach teacher or a parent that could ve a wise individual to talk to when you have a problem some students do not have good role models at home and trusted adults may also ve a good individual to follow

students may learn new skills or improve at what theyre good at

when people hear something they think they dont like their first reaction would ve negative i think students should ve pushed out of the it doesnt look fun so i dont like it mindset it is an obstacle to trying new things and will never help the student trying new things can unleash new interests and will help a student with their life path because it will ve easier to pick a college major job or elective that is very important because many students when they have graduated from high school dont know what they want to employ as therefore it wastes time that the student can ve using for college university or employment a student can continue an extracurricular activity that they are good at and it will help them improve at that skill most professional athletes artists and musicians have been practicing since childhood and that is how they became a professional and students can accomplish that too if they try their vest and join an activity

overall students learn an abundance of skills while doing extracurricular activities like communication skills healthy habits time management creative and critical thinking and many more there is no harm in trying new things so why not join an extracurricular activity today",0,education
"many schools require students to work on summer projects to make size they continue to learn throughout the summer break i personally believe that these projects should all be student designed because the students can relate to the project easier and the students also prefer projects that aze generally visually pleasing

firstly i genuinely think that student designed projects should be used because the students can relate to it much easier than other type of projects many teachers dont understand this generation and due to this issue students cant enjoy projects that aze mainly teachezdesigned if the projects aze student designed many students would be excited to complete it student designed projects can include many things happening in this new generation for example in the tenth grade i had to complete a project in english in this project i had to include examples of zeal life issues happening in this new generation many teachers would not understand half of the examples that were included so student designed projects should be used over summer break

secondly many students like to do projects that look very nice another season why student designed projects should be used is because they can be made visually pleasing i personally enjoy being able to make a project that is appealing to look at for example in chemistry last year we had a huge project to complete at the end of the semester this project was also a student designed project in this project we were making chemistry board games to help study for the final the students in the classroom all had to make that own board game but the best part of it was the fact that we could make it look however we wanted it to the students could make it insanely colorful and as big as we pleased in the end i still believe that student designed projects should be used for students to continue learning throughout that break

on the other hand teachezdesigned projects can also be a huge help to those students that need it there is a possibility that certain students may enjoy teachezdesigned projects more in these type of projects the teacher likes to include a large amount of words and also like a certain difficulty some teachers believe that they should have more difficult work to give the students an understanding of how difficult it may be once they start the school year for example in algebra 2 last year we had a teachezdesigned project that we had to complete i personally was having issues learning in that class and i always needed help in this project he included a lot of words and made it very difficult to understand but since he made it very difficult it began making me think a lot handed since i was thinking handed i began to work handed so in this situation teachezdesigned projects would help certain students continue you learn and work had throughout the long summer break

in conclusion while students aze on summer break they would more than likely enjoy completing student designed projects because they could easily relate to the project and they also get to use that creative side with visually pleasing projects with an exception to those who need help in that classes they would enjoy more teachezdesigned projects ",0,education

"i believe the technology of driverless cars is necessary in todays society and should be used for its worth one of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accuse at any moment i believe that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone and not just inexperienced or handicapped drivers i am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very and i am very cautious of my peers driving too furthermore i would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself with out the drivers noticing and possibly stopping to stop a collision or save my very own life furthermore i would very much like to see this technology come to fruition and let the world harness its abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future

the laws against the use of these driverless cars are very reasonable too and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws i believe they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step forward for safety and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings they dont seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today if you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives these laws make me question us as a society more than ever and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences if we cannot test our ideas be must further some to the new technologies we have available at this time but we must not lose ourselves in context be had to push towards breaking these laws against testing and accept the new technology for the future

as a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future one day i hope to be sitting in a cab thats driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath to survive this is yet another thing to admire of these driverless cars and that is the ability to use much fewer amounts of fuel rather than traditional vehicles as you may already know cars push out lots of burned fossil fuels but with the new technology that has been presented these cars can use less fossil fuels the burning of less fossil fuels is a thumbs up and has a lesser impact on the world rather than a world without them

i gladly accept the new technologies that driverless cars have presented to me today and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors i can guarantee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society the further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles the technology of the future is here and we need it to help save the lives of many people be as the society of the future should not stand back and watch the possibilities of our future be restricted by laws that just dont understand the purpose of this technology",0,education

"as the work summer enters you mind the thought of a beaming sun turbulent waves anz tropical islands may subconsciously enter your mind summer is the longest break given to students within the united states education system this evokes the fear that with all this time spent out of school students will begin loosing their ability to learn some schools are deciding to tackle this issue by administering summer projects during break to assure that students continue their education with that being said the question of who gets to design these projects must be asked should teachers be given another responsibility on their shoulders or should students be given the freedom to create their own educational project to ensure that students receive both a resting period from the rigor of school while maintaining their educational abilities they should be given the ability to design their own summer project by allowing students to zo so projects can be tailored to meet individual academic rigor be altered to fit personal goals of the students anz provides a more fun anz engaging activity which will motivate them to learn

it is no surprise that each student in the educational system has their own set of challenges anz intellectual abilities forcing the same content to each student completely neglects this fact some students may feel extremely challenge while others may feel as if they are not being challenge enough to combat this issue students should be provide the ability to choose the rigor of their own summer project as a result each student will be challenge just enough to the point where are on their toes academically but zo not feel consumer by the content of the work itself many of the worlds accomplished scientists felt suffocate in the curriculum mandate environment of school anz were only able to thrive when afforded the opportunity to curate their own work for example albert einstein einstein himself struggle in school anz eventually lead to him leaving the education system his greatest findings however came when he was given the ability to create his own project by going so einstein could fine things that challenge him even though it was different from what the school system had implemented some people may argue that allowing students to set the bar on their own academic rigor will allow them a scapegoat to choose easy topics education is a self discovered path that must be navigate by the student apart from the fact that teachers already have so much on their plate anz jazzing project planning on top will place more stress on them a student has the right to challenge themselves as needed this does not mean that a student is alone in this path teachers should be given the ability to approve anzor disapprove of project ideas therefore both parties can fine a happy medium the intensity of the project being custom tailored to the student will allow them to better comprehend the information in a way that is not driving a hatred towards education

with that being said stuzentzesignez projects also give children the opportunity to focus their content around personal goals anz interests the project itself can be used as an exploration tool for student in what they hope to be their future career or a subject they show high levels of interest in for example a student interested in medicine has the opportunity to learn about medicine this way she has more context when deciding what she would like to zo in the future if teachers were to design their projects it would be impossible to ensure that the interests of every single student is met hence allowing students to decide what they choose to learn about warrants the ability for them to learn what they love this information they gain could seem to be vital when they decide minor things such as what classes to take the following year all the way to larger aspects such as what careers they would enjoy many of the top chief executive officers in technology companies struggle with this situation their schools liz to provide them the ability to explore different topics anz careers hence they left anz decided to tackle it themselves people like bill gates on the other heinz were given opportunities in school to explore computers anz software he credits all his success to these very opportunities given to him this demonstrates the importance of sanctioning the ability for students to learn about their focuses this way they will not only learn but understand their strengths anz weaknesses

finally by allowing students to design their own project the learning aspect becomes more exciting anz engaging motivation is essential when trying to get students to learn anz cooperate this characteristic can be hard to cultivate when students are forces to learn subjects that zo not excite them if given the opportunity to choose their own projects students will pick something that intrigues them this curiosity will make it easier for them to want to learn anz eventually continue learning many successful people end up going well in fields that are similar to their favorite subject in school this shows the probable direct relationship between enjoyment in subjects anz eventual work ethic when it comes to these subjects some may argue that this will prompt students to choose a childish project however it is important to remember that there are still guidelines place on the project teachers should still be granted the ability to view proposed project topics anz either accept or reject them nonetheless enjoyable projects will motivate students to actively learn

summer should no longer represent a time when students loose previously gain knowledge education is an extremely important aspect of students lives anz to ensure that they foster their love anz passion for learning students should be given the opportunity to design their personal summer projects",0,education
"drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle

drivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting while using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing according to the national safety council cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 16 million crashes a year nearly 390000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash well according to been safety over 3287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash

distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage eating drinking operating a radio or even being lost in thought it can lead to injuries or even death when a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident

when drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone elses life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their lives or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them

so in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someones life whether its the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle  ",0,healthcare
"have you ever wondered why does that person know how to do everything right all the time or how do they know the right thing to tell you well statistics show that 80 of people who ask for multiple opinions for important decisions are more successful than the average person so if you take advice from multiple people like the those smart and wise people do then you dont make as many mistakes you gain wisdom and understand different points of view

first off multiple pieces of advice can help you not make as many mistakes say you need help with memorizing bone names in anatomy class and you ask a friend how to help memorize your terms the advice your friend gives you will help you make fewer mistakes on remembering your anatomy terms another example is the president when he needs help on things like national defense he then can ask his cabinet for advice on what to do and he can make fewer mistakes for our country so advice helps with fewer mistakes

secondly many bits of advice can make you gain wisdom a great example of is elderly people they have lived through lots of different experiences that they can teach you not to do a story of this is when i was about 7 i went to this camp called camp generic_city and at camp generic_city was a giant hill called generic_city when lots of kids got there they wanted to run down the hill but it was very dangerous because of the rocks and roots on the hill one day i wanted to run down the hill but the older gentleman called old generic_name said that it way too dangerous because it had rained the night before he told me a story of how someone had to go to the hospital because of running down the hill i was very stubborn and still decided to run down the hill with my friends we then ran down the hill and i fell and got a concussion basically wisdom from advice can help you not to do something naive

lastly getting several pieces of advice helps you understand different points of view so when you ask for advice about what is the best way to drag a deer down the mountain you could ask lots of people some might say to tie it up and drag it and some might say to carry it but they know this from their point of view of the best way to do it also if you ask a couple of people how to handle a problem at work and they give you an answer based on how they see a problem they get to see their point of view on the problem

to sum it all up getting multiple opinions from people can help with making less mistakes you can gain wisdom and understand different points of view basically advice helps you learn and understand different problems so when you want to be like those smart and wise people just ask the people around you for advise ",0,healthcare
"have you ever been stuck on a difficult situation

well try seeking multiple opinions

seeking multiple opinions can definitely help someone make a better choice

seeking opinions can help you by hearing on which opinions are better learn from others experience and can help explore your mind on other options

hearing different opinions can help you choose which opinion is the best

for example when f was designing a dress for a friend f asked my mom which fabric will work best

my mom suggested cotton and gave her reasoning why but when f asked my sister she suggested silk

my family will always have different opinions when f ask for advice

therefore f will always ask them first to see their opinions

another example is when f was trying to decide if f should go to the cardinal

a few of my friends had said no because they have heard horrible things about it but most of my friends said yes

f decided to not go because of the cardinals safety issues

this example shows on how hearing different opinions can reflect on me

lastly f was having some difficulty on if f should straighten or curl my hair

f had asked my friends and they recommended that f curl my hair

this shows that hearing different opinions can change on what you think

all of these examples help me out on a daily basis

hearing different experiences can also help you choose on your situation

for example when f asked my sisters on which elective was the most amusing they had both said facs

they both recommended me facs because they had a lot of fun in that class in their past

other peoples experiences can help me a humongous amount in choosing electives

another example is what type of job f want to have in the future

since my dad is a lawyer and my mom is a nurse

f can hear both of their experiences on their jobs

their sharing of experiences puts my mind into a different aspect

lastly when f had asked my friends on which clothing brand has the best quality of shorts

from all of my friends shopping experiences they had said american eagle

sharing experiences also helps me choose which clothing brand is the best for shorts

sharing experiences can change my entire mind on what f should do

seeking for multiple opinions helps your mind explore on even more options

for example when f asked my friends for where f should go for spring break they recommended to me mexico or california

f wasnt interested in either so f decided jamaica

this example shows on how my mind decided to explore and choose a different state or country

another example is when f asked for my friends opinion on the outfits f had picked and they all either chose outfit one or outfit two

f decided to be bold and go for outfit three

this shows how my mind went to a different path

one last example is when f had asked my sisters which book f should read and they both recommended me cinderella

f chose to sleep beauty instead because it caught my attention

although they both had said cinderella f still chose sleeping beauty

hearing multiple opinions can explore my mind on way more options f can choose for the future

f believe that seeking multiple opinions has a huge benefit on you and your future

seeking opinions will help you choose the best options hear from others experiences and explore your mind for greater potential

overall these all have a huge impact on everyone

seeking multiple opinions can even change the word",0,healthcare
"dear florida senator

would you like to vote or do you feel obligated to vote i personally want my vote to make a difference i would want to keep the electoral college because it excess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live in  if you are willing to vote choose carefully and be precise with your answer dont let others get in your way its your choice and time so express a political preference rather than deciding an election

first of all voting is all about the candidates try to understand and know the candidates before voting voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate if you didnt know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years infill your able to vote again for a different candidate

secondly if you dont want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference then im sure others feel the same way a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions

thirdly candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and secure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the swing states its great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count

in conclusion we cannot control electors who want to vote for a candidate that others may disagree on but we can control our own vote

its your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for your vote can make a difference and every bit counts so there is a reason to have the electoral college  ",0,healthcare
"by limiting car usage you would be making it a heather environment and a safer one

there would be less pollution in the air and that would make the air better for us to breath

sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people its also doing us a favor whether we like it or not because constantly breathing in polluted air is awful for you it can have major affects on our lungs and restore system also by limiting car usage you wouldst spend so much money on gas oil car parts ect so by saving all that money you could spend it on something else

when you own a vehicle you put in so much money in just getting your insurance and then you spend so much money on gases every week dont get me wrong the gas prices have gone down but what will happen when they go back up and how much money will the gas be then

so is driving worth killing your air and the environment you live in and spend all your money on gas

cr would it better for us to start limiting our car usage

but that is up for you to decide what you want to do

the driving have you ever thought how much pollution you vehicle is dishing out while your driving around town probably not probably you were thinking how log till i get there or i need to text someone back but i bet not once did car pollution ever cross you mind and its okay not a lot of people think about it when they are driving actually hardly anyone think sabot it ever unless its on the news saying that the air pollution is bad again and thats when you start to think about it

with car pollution you dont reals what it is dont to you environment because you never see it happen in a fast pace it always happens really slow

all of a sudden plants will start to die really fast people will have really hard time breathing and will probably have to go to the hospital because of the lack of oxygen they can get

imagine saving you money wouldst that be nice not having to worry about a car payment or gas

alot of people would have so much money that a lot of them need because there is a lot of families struggling to make it by the have to constantly worry if they have enough money to pay the bills and put gases in their vehicle to get to work to make the money to survive

what if instead of having a vehicle and constantly spending money on gas you walked or took a bike to work imagine all that money you saved by doing something little as that",0,healthcare
"you like your bar right what if i told you that not only are you putting yourself in danger but everyone else in the world as well you might not know it but you really are and its a big problem there are many ways to fix this but in this base we would try using the easiest that is to limit the use of bars now hold on before you throw this away like paper continue reading on so you know what kind of help you would be doing if we limit the driving for not only you but everyone in this world limiting use of the bar you drive today will improve your safety pollution and others safety as well dont just stop at a red light stop hurting the surrounding things

bubble up safety first all those sayings that your parents or drivers ed teachers have told you are not just for them to control you they actually mean to help you but your just so excited about driving you dont even pay attention see if you have a bar you must pay a forty thousand dollar parking space in vauban its a bar free zone and some people actually like it as a result 70 percent of vaubans families do not own bars and 57 percent sold there bar to mover there when youre in a bar you always feel so tense dont you in my opinion its because your afraid of getting hurt or into a brash if we limited the time of driving you wouldnt have to be so tense because there would be fewer people around you

now the world is dying dont feel frightened or ashamed but this is sort of your fault you band see it but when you drive a bar gas comes out the back and into the earths atmosphere this is balled pollution and it isnt one of the good guys in our base its a bad guy that need to be and should be stopped it wont be one of those quick novels either and will take a lot of your support but it would be done limiting everyones driving uses will help try saving the earth from what we are doing to it paris typically has more smog than other european capitals and just last week had 147 micrograms of particular matter this is the danger to the world and the earth just wont stop fighting back

look out wow that was close from hitting you see there in the road is a line that forms a lane a lane shows you the area you ban drive on and all you have to do is stay in the lane you put her peoples lives at risk if you drive anywhere besides that lane and even yourself dont be selfish enough to just worry about yourself but aware enough on where youre going and how you are to get there causing a bar brash will get you nowhere in life except the hospital which believe me is not one of the best places to take your new friend limiting the use of bars will help you keep your aware sup and about in base the worst of event would happen

so limiting a bar usage is not such a bad thing now is it instead of thinking of yourself think of your safety the pollution and others safety it would make a real difference in the world if we would just limit the use need to go somewhere try using a gibibyte or skateboard and you will find it might be a little slower but will get you where you need to go with almost no damage warranties you never know you might like it so much yo would have your own personal spongebob bar free zone on your door that you bought after selling your bar this does not include the spongebob bar free zone bible either which is sold separately from the store nearest you",0,healthcare
"in a split second you could ruin your future injure or kill others and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you and that quote is by sharon heit mother of texting and driving victim this essay is about if drivers should or shouldnt be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle there is a lot of pros and cons on if people should or shouldnt be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle as a teenager i see the good and the bad but it doesnt always means that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing

in my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldnt be allowed manly because there are more cons then there are pros and if i was driving i wouldnt be able to text anyone because i cant multitask and if i got into a car accident i wouldnt be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone and im the type of person that dont like pain or going to the hospital

if you dont keep your attention on the road bad things can happen including put others lifes in danger putting your life in danger braking hearts of others and sometimes youre on heart going to court if the victim trys to sue you an example of putting other peoples life in danger lets say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happen that you cant take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well and getting into a car crash isnt always safe people can die on the scene and you couldnt do anything about it so that brakes others heart and possible yours

the pros of cellphone used while driving navigation traffic reports crime reporting communication with a friend or a parents or if you have children now days the cars have navigation in them and if they dont you can have cellphone holders for your phone communication with a friend or even a family member about something thats going on and youre trying to get to where they are and if you have children and you dont know where they are and youre trying to get a hold of them

this essay is about if drivers should or shouldnt be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and i dont think people should drive and use there cell phone there can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle the exception can be about a death or a child and of course navigation and this is my opinion on if people should or shouldnt be able to operate a vehicle while driving          ",0,healthcare

"if someone wants to grow more as a person they will have to try different things i believe that ralph waldo emerson is right to grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get if a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the truth is that he only know what he mastered but if a pearson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future

an example of this is pique he is a famous soccer player he gets pay a lot of money but to grow more as a person he also become a business man now pique have a lot of companies that work for him he also created his own tennis league in spain pique also support a foundation that his wife created to help kids in colombia

other example is one of my uncles from generic_city his mane is generic_name he studies to be a teacher he was very happy with his work but to grow more and get more knowledge he goes back to college to study to become a doctor now he feels like he knows more and that he have grown more as a person

i also like to thing that im an example of this i always try to do my best to laird different sports furthermore im a perfect soccer player but i prefer to try others sports furthermore i play a different sport every day because i feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as an athlete furthermore i also like to study a lot for the classes that im having problems because i get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student



people can still grow when they mastered something an example of this is leonel fess he is a soccer he has play soccer all his lifes he was always getting better and better every year he never plays other sport in his lifes now he is considered one of the best player in the world he grows as a person by doing what he already mastered

people have to do different things in their lifes if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie they are the best in what they mastered but they dont have any type of knowledge in other thing in conclusion if someone wants to grow more as a person he will have to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge",0,healthcare
"phones can be the best thing in our day and age because technology changing everyday people die in a car accident because they were distracted by their cell phones while driving people use their phones while driving to keep in touch with some people when it can wait even connecting your phone to your car for hands free its still dangerous because your more into texting or snapping someone back when it can wait if its an emergency you should pull over and put your car in park and do what you need to do instead of endangering yourself or other drivers on the road with you

many people say that handsfree set is a safety because you have 2 hands on the wheel instead of one on your phone and the other on the wheel but however i think its still not safe because you would be more into texting or calling someone instead of driving people have been immune to their phones that they have to be on their phone every second even while driving its not just young drivers its older experienced drivers too

many more people say its not safe to drive while with your phone because youre endangering your life and other drivers che leading causes of death in a car accidents are drunk drivers or distracted drivers nowadays you cant just drive your car you have to look around your surrounding for an example car swerving in your lane while on their phone what would you do speed up or slow down or stay riding next to them you have to be on your ps and qs while driving because you have inexperienced drivers and experts what ever is on your phone could wait because its not going away instead of risking your life while driving

in conclusion dont use your phone or operate your phone while driving because it can lead to many more problems than texting backok you dont want to end up in the hospital thinking why did i do that i shouldve waited youre not going to think about that while driving obvious the person youre texting dont care about you if they texting you while your driving if people dont put their phones to the side its going to be more deaths in car accidents they shouldnt endanger many other people lives for a simple text or something dont think about just your self think about other lives on the road with you you also have to watch out for other drivers too  ",0,healthcare
"do you think the facial action coding is 100 percent valuable and correct in mg personal opinion i sag no i have three reason that can explain who this technology is not valuable i could be frowning and be happy but showing a sign of jog dont always trust technology it sometimes can lead in the wrong wag im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong

in the article it said for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply bg the look on her face thats very incorrect because many times ill ask mg friend how she is feeling when she looks grumpy she would sag im good with me not knowing that because me thinking her facial expression is saying something different people ask me all the time whats wrong with me when i turn out to be just chilling some people natural look might just be a mug i learned that the hard wag its so very true

trusting technology can give you false information i remember this time i sprained mg foot i went to the doctor to get in drag and the drag information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time although im glad the doctor knew what he was doing he then figures out that the inner of mg foot was spawned the bone was slightly bent and i needed time to heal it and recover it sounds like the facial action coding system is like a drag machine

i understand that the facial action coding system is a use of technology with that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right you can get stuff off the internet thats not true information but get its a source of technology many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project you never know if the stuff is true because an gone can edit it so you can compare the facial action coding system with getting information off of the internet these are both sources of technology

is it a possibility that the facial coding system is valuable yes but i wouldnt put all of mg trust into it just because im frowning dont assume that something is wrong with me or if someone just has a mug as a look dont think that their mad it can come back that four wrong believing that everything with technology is true is very false it is a good chance that the technology is off the facial coding system like a drag scanning sometimes it can give true information sometimes it cant  ",0,healthcare

in todays day in ane drivers range from the ane of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like band able to seamlessly mere into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back but a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not band fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a manner to them or anyone around them this is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in america with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly reasons like this is why most cars dont have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver driving while band on a phone is also illegal in some states like georgia hawaii idaho and illinois with a fine of 5000 and up to 1 year in prison the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk

the first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash its been documented that 19 of drivers of all ones admit to surfing the web while driving in a blog post by naomi shaolin pllc it statesthis one is pretty obvious but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive according to the national safety council 16 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year if you dont want to crash your car and net injured or even killed dont text and drive these statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldnt overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesnt net published enough most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have brown up with older figures who do the same a good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that statescell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers in 2017 according to the national highway traffic safety administration 3166 people were killed in 2935 distraction affected crashes accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the united states knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a lifethreatening norm talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers this article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think its okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though its never safe it also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and dont know how to multitask a car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining ptsd from the experience with that band said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash

the second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk many people use their phones while driving when theyre with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so in another blog post by naomi shaolin pllc it saysnot only does texting and driving put your own life at risk but it also bravely endangers the lives of other people around you as a driver you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car but also for other motorists on the road not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers speaking of pedestrians you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and net on the road well you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap this piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other peoples wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street it also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if youre willing to put them in such grave manner in that case another good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that saysbecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused make a family commitment not to use distraction devices while driving according to research conducted at childrens hospital of philadelphia chop teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks this article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someones mindset it also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving

in conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road the road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people no out of their way to still put many lives in manner because of the inconvenience consequences netting caught driving while band on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums banning about band reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrub it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right  ",0,healthcare

"today  drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle why  because too many accidents are happening causing people to lose their loved ones and important people in their life another reason is because it is a law now and you shouldnt be breaking the law then it causes a lack og driving skills

everyday people die in car accident because they use cell phones over the past couple og years over 15 million people have lost their life or loved ones due to people being on their phones while driving being on your phone while driving is so dangerous because you can hit somebody and cause a bad wreck possibly killing somebody putting them in the hospital making them paralyzed and not just that but losing your car people should not use cell phones while driving because a person could be having a conversation they might get upset and it could cause the driver to lose control og the car

people should not use cell phones while driving because its a law you shouldnt want to break ig you are caught breaking the law og no cell phones while driving it could result in bad consequences consequences of getting your license suspended and not being able to drive until further notice also you might get a ticket or taken to jail and thats something you dont want ig its something so important that you have to check your phone you should pull over or wait until you get to where you are going they have invented a phone dock were you sit your phone while driving and i still think its usage because people are still attempting to still use their phones while driving

people who are usually using phones while driving seem to have lack og driving skills which causes the car to go ogg the road maybe get too close to another car and can end up in the lane next to them lack og driving skills is the biggest thing that most people have today using phones can cause drives to take their eyes ogg the road their hands ogg the road this appears to have the biggest impact on a lot og drivers that use their phones while driving

people shouldnt use phones while driving it would stop a lot pg car accidents tickets death lack og driving skills etc igs drivers put their phones down while driving this would save a lot og lives been taking due to car accidents ig people dont give up cell phones while driving the number og fatalities on the road will increase each year with all this being said

first when we are accomplish something we need to be proud of yourself  it is wonderful when other people are getting done their goals

second we may not believe on what other people said to you because sometimes you are right but if you pay attention you can go down with your goals that why you have to finish your accomplish alone

also when we done something we feel very happy and that can help us to follow what we actually need to be a great people

for example if we are idle we never can be great on our future we need to know and be sure that if we do not follow our dream it can not come true like when you are in the college and you said i need to be a nurse or something like that you have to go to the college every single day and stay strong for all that you are making and when you done you will see your that dream come true and them you can see all the effort that you did

"boom the sound of ginourmous truck slamming into a house full of people  smoke everywere theres about to be a fire many people are unconcious or dead more than half of the people in the house are rushed to the hospital as you can see there has been an atrocious accident because of that vehicle their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents  people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people

obviously were having a lot of problems with money in this world  if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot see as it states in source one paragraph two  a carowner buys a space for forty thousand dollars  along with a home with those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world  it aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now who needs a car when you can just walk stores are placed a walk away on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway source one paragraph 6

pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it so heres an idea lets ban driving due to smog says paris their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city do you agree with that well i do and heres why  paris has more smog than other european capitals so if they dont stop the smog its going to be horrific for their city source three paragraph twenty one  the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smognot having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of bogota

their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful usually when theres traffic you hear a lot honking and theres a lot fines for that the fines are very expensive to pay so youre wasting a lot of money also when people are honking they dont realize that other people are sleeping  everyone needs sleep  some people cant sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam theyre awake sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that 

so in conclusion what im saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way people living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well traffic is not good for the world either because it is stressful an it is not good for people to be stressed    ",0,healthcare
"driving while using cell phones

many people take chances and put other peoples lives in danger by using their cellphones while driving numerous deaths and injuries occur from those driving and using cell phones simultaneously using cellphones while driving causes needless accidents it is almost impossible to efficiently multitask the harm and effects of the accidents and deaths are farreaching drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving

sadly numerous people are killed or injured annually due to accidents specifically many deaths are caused by car accidents and the accidents are from teens and even grown individuals using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle in 2015 studies showed that about 72 of deaths were caused by accidents and about 44 of the accidents were caused because the teen was driving a motor vehicle while using their cellular device

for many driving is a daily activity not requiring much thought or consideration however the sad reality is that there are 3287 deaths each day due to fatal car crashes teen testing while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road not on their cell phones or other mobile devices

it has been proven that one cannot successfully multitask while it might seem like you are accomplishing many things at once research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think we are in fact some researchers suggest that multitasking can actually reduce productivity by as much as 40 percent teen this means that someone operating a motor vehicle cannot operate the vehicle and use their phone at the same time without an accident happening or losing concentration of the road while trying it in 2019 36 of respondents aged 1824 admitted to testing while driving of those who admitted to testing while driving 51 in 2019 an individual that was operating a motor vehicle and also on their cellular device at the same time lost control of the wheel and as they were losing control of the wheel spun out causing them to merge over into a lake and died because of drowning mccarty at each nj williams af and powell tc drivers are distracted decreasing the drivers awareness on the road leading to more car crashes which proves why multitasking is nearly impossible to do successfully and why it should not be done while driving

the effects of the accidents that drivers are causing are horrific because the effects that the accidents and deaths caused are farreaching drivers should not be using cellphones while driving because not only is it lifethreatening but it also can be life changing in 2016 there was an incident that happened when a car rammed into the back of another vehicle 2016 the person whose car was hit was rushed to the hospital immediately this person was paralyzed for the rest of his life this man now struggles with seeing his kids because he has problems with mobility which prevents him from doing regular everyday activities that we take for granted

"most people think that driving is a top priority there are other ways of getting from place to place there are many advantages of limiting car usage for instance there will be no more pollution most people stopped driving and many people will gain plenty of exercise without the use of cars there are many other positive ways to get around the city instead of driving a car

this world already has enough pollution but with the limitations to car use there wont be cars these days give off extra gas that is harmful to the animals plants and even people according to source 3 carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotá by andrew silky it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 million the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog violators faced 25 fines this cause is a good way to lower air pollution for example many women and some men face the struggle of having breast cancer on certain days there will be a walk to help cure breast cancer it wont stop it completely but its a great cause to help cure it according to source 1 in german suburb life goes on without cars by elisabeth rosenthal automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their homes and that experts say is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe the efforts are strong and with more people being included will help make the air pollution lower to a better percentage for example when people are sick they have to take medicine in order to get better this world and the atmosphere will become a better place to live if more people get involved with the limited auto use

driving isnt in the number one spot on thingstodo anymore most people stopped driving in america according source 4 the end of car culture by elisabeth rosenthal recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by the change in fewer people getting a car will also be a good way to stop traffic in the cities for instance if someone brings in chocolate cupcakes but no one except one person likes chocolate then they would take more for them same with the road less people on the road the more room for people who want to or need to drive to some place also in source 4 as of april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995 a lot of people cant afford cars or even think they are a waste of money for example no one would buy something that they dont necessarily need people would take the money and use it for something more important there are many advantages of limiting car usage when people stop driving that means there wouldnt be a lot of people on the road there will be more space for people that have emergencies or important business errands or people that just want to drive

without many cars around due to limited auto usage people will have the advantage to exercise there are many people that are overweight and need help to fix it according to source 3 carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotá by andrew silky in a program thats set to spread to other countries millions of colombians hiked biked and skated to work during a carefree day yesterday without cars for a limited time would be a great idea to take control and work out it helps people live a healthier lifestyle and build muscle for instance some kids are forced out of the house for at least an hour of play time and get on track to become healthy not just children should be doing this but also adults although when someone needs to get to some place taking a car would be quicker but having no cars has advantages too some people might complain and be too lazy to go ride a bike to the store but as a result in the end the person on the bike will be in better shape than the person in the car there is nothing wrong in staying fit when there isnt an option in driving a car somewhere

"by limiting car usage you would be making it a heather environment and a safer one

there would be less pollution in the air and that would make the air better for us to breath

sure by limiting the usage of cars would have an effect on people its also doing us a favor whether we like it or not because constantly breathing in polluted air is awful for you it can have major affects on our lungs and restore system also by limiting car usage you wouldst spend so much money on gas oil car parts ect so by saving all that money you could spend it on something else

when you own a vehicle you put in so much money in just getting your insurance and then you spend so much money on gases every week dont get me wrong the gas prices have gone down but what will happen when they go back up and how much money will the gas be then

so is driving worth killing your air and the environment you live in and spend all your money on gas

or would it better for us to start limiting our car usage

but that is up for you to decide what you want to do

the driving have you ever thought how much pollution you vehicle is dishing out while your driving around town probably not probably you were thinking how log till i get there or i need to text someone back but i bet not once did car pollution ever cross you mind and its okay not a lot of people think about it when they are driving actually hardly anyone think sabot it ever unless its on the news saying that the air pollution is bad again and thats when you start to think about it

with car pollution you dont reals what it is dont to you environment because you never see it happen in a fast pace it always happens really slow

all of a sudden plants will start to die really fast people will have really hard time breathing and will probably have to go to the hospital because of the lack of oxygen they can get

imagine saving you money wouldst that be nice not having to worry about a car payment or gas

alot of people would have so much money that a lot of them need because there is a lot of families struggling to make it by the have to constantly worry if they have enough money to pay the bills and put gases in their vehicle to get to work to make the money to survive

"do you think the facial action coding is 100 percent valuable and correct in my personal opinion i say no i have three reason that can explain why this technology is not valuable i could be frowning and be happy but showing a sign of joy dont always trust technology it sometimes can lead in the wrong way im amuse that people are relying on technology to lead them in a direction that could be wrong

in the article it said  for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feelging simply by the look on her face thats very incorrect because many times ill ask my friend how she is feeling when she looks grumpy she would say im good with me not knowing that because me thinking her facial expression is saying something different people ask me all the time whats wrong with me when i turn out to be just chilling some people natural look might just be a mug i learned that the hard way its so very true

trusting technology can give you false information i remember this time i sprained my foot i went to the doctor to get in xray and the xray information was showing that nothing was wrong with it for a period of time although im glad the doctor knew what he was doing he then figure out that the inner of my foot was spained the bone was slightly bent and i needed time to heal it and recover it sounds like the facial action coding system is like a xray machine

i understand that the facial action coding system is a use of technology with that being known we can believe that the technology want always be right you can get stuff off the internet thats not true information but yet its a source of technology many people just go to get there information off of wikipedia for a research project you never know if the stuff is true because any one can edit it so you can compare the facial action coding sysytem with gettig information off of the internet these are both sources of technology

is it a possibility that the facial coding system is valuable yes but i wouldnt put all of my trust into it just because im frowning dont assume that something is wrong with me or if someone just has a mug as a look dont think that their mad it can come back that your wrong believeing that everything with technology is true is very false it a good chance that the technology is off the facial coding sysytem like a xray scanning sometimes it can give true information sometimes it cant        ",0,healthcare

first it can cause a car accident to happen and in some cases even worst when using a phone while driving it doesnt let you pay attention towards thx road yourx driving on

this includes thx driver having yes on his phone and that moment that thx person is paying attention to their phone they may not stop in time if something or someone were to pass by them in front of their car this types of accidents happen often because of drivers using their phones while driving

second of all phones arx considered illegal in some states which can cause a ticket or fine to bx paid for even if thx state says its legal you can get more of a bigger pay fine if thx driver were to violate any other law and proven that thx person was using a phone thx fine or ticket can bx a bigger punishment for those using a phone while driving in most cases that involve accidents more legal actions can occur from using a phone while operating a phone as well

third of all phones while driving is a high leading cause of death this cases where car accidents happen could not only and up in a hospital bxd most cases that occur with thx driver being distracted by their phone involves more fatal collisions when you become unaware of your surroundings for those seconds spent on your phone while driving it allows for only thx the worst car accidents to happen therefore leading to thx cause of death

in addition this technology advancement was created only to help people as consumers we always think about what would this do for he with that being said the facial action coding system could have a positive effect on our medicines entertainment and medical technology in the text it statesthe seize technology can make cozputeranizated faces more expressivefor video gazes or video surgery the one thing i think about when i hear america is sports which is a for of entertainment the new technology could benefit our use of televisions and radios or szartphoneswhich we watch sports on another thing i think about it when someone is speaking about this country is medical purposes our country has amazing medical advances and technology the facial coding could help create a better understanding or a better alternative for complicated technology then again as consumers we also spend a lot of time on social media or looking at ads sometimes there are things we are not interested in at all but they annoyingly still pop up with the facial coding our faces can be detected if we like the ad and if we do not like the ad this benefits us greatly because it shows what we do want to see and what we do not want to see in the text it statesfor example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad light follow but if you frown the next ad will be different many light say this does not latter but ads are everywhere and our world is only going to rely on computers or other forms of technology so why not embrace it and try to advance too

in conclusion the facial action coding system serves great purpose and value to us as consumers because it is created to help us understand our history and advance in other technology",0,healthcare

"my positions on driverless cars is that they shouldnt exist those in the next generation wouldnt know what it would feel like to drive your very first car let sit on the drivers side dont get me wrong i understand that it was possible for google to create a car that drove itself for half a million miles without crashing bdt you have to understand that freak accidents happen in the world that we cant prevent

what would happen if an elderly woman is on the highway in a driverless car and the car starts to malfunction and spins off the road she may know how to drive bdt her reaction isnt quick enough to stop the car freak accidents happen every day technology is so advanced nowadays that i feel like it is to much power in some of odr hands people get carried away and start building things much more powerful than themselves and become power hungry we have seen it on so many occasions that we are oblivious to it

we have drones coming in hospitals now performing surgeries for surgeons who are unavailable at the moment not only is that to advanced it is also putting people odt of a job what would happen to the cab drivers all around the world what would they do they would have to start all the way over with a new profession those who are barely making it in the ideal society struggle as it is to find a job so with people coming dp with ideas like this i feel as if they are being selfcentered and not thinking about those who arent able to provide for their household as it is now

"there are many thing in life people want and need such as money families and fame but what people dont understand is that most of what they want is stuff they dont need and they would be better off without it cars are beginning to be something people dont need all it is doing is causing more problems then solutions major people are starting to noticepresidents and governments and are acting apon it limiting car usage would bring a lot of advantages such as more pocket money more excrises and less harm to the earth acorrding to carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota by andrew selsky paris bans driving due to smog by robert duffer and the end of car culture by elisabeth rosenthal

cars are defined as a motor veshel that provides fast transportation for more then one person at a time thats what most people veiw it as what that dont know and relize is that it give people a lot more stress to deal with because of either car payments repairs or even runing out of gas acorrding to heidrun walter in the passage in german suburb life goes on without cars she said that when she had a car she was always tense and now that she doesnt have a car sge is more relaxed and is better off without it she doesnt have to pay for insurance car payments repairs on the car and not even gas that will leave her with a lot of stress free moments

cars do not only stress out people but they are pulloting the earth almost all cars run on gas which is put in the car and releases pollution into the earth paris had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of pollution that is how much damage it is doing to the earth it took five days the smog finally rivaled beijing china which is know as one of the most pullated cities in the world this could have made people go to the hospital because they could have gotten sick or even die from the pollution many countries are banning cars for a couple of days each year because of this global problem according to carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota in colombia they have a program that bans cars a for a day which leaves people to walk hike or even bike to where they need to go its a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution said carlos arturo plaza

furthermore not only does it help the envirment for limting car usage and gives relief to peopl it will also make people healther because they would then have to walk ride or hike to work or any other place thay need to go this will strength peoples bodies by doing everyday things more often it would require more work to walk to a destiantion rather then to sit down in a car and press on the brake and gas pedal with our foot limting car usage will not only make people helthier but it will make people less lazy for example if a person was lazy and had no food in hisher house they would just easly get in there car and drive to a local fast food restruant to get food on ther other hand if they did not have a car they would have to walk all the way to the grocery story burning off lots of caliores and buying lots more food rather then stoping at a fast food place just to get a quick meal

"there are some advantages and some disadvantages for having and not having a car u need a car just incase for an emergency and then there is an a advantege for no having a car and that is less pollution in the air

first i like to talk about the disadvanteges for not having a car not having a car means more walking or bike riding  and then there is always being late to work or being late to something because you do not have a car to drive people need to have a car because they have to go to work everyday are just to go have fun or go anywhere

the second disadvatege for not having a car is when there is an emergency if there is an emergency hiow are you going to get to the hospital or to the doctors if you dont have a car having a car is beteter than not having a car for an example if a person gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital how are they going to get there if they dont have a car

the third the thing i like to to talk about is the advantages for not having a car not having a car will help people got more excersice and help them move about around not having a car will help with having more money to spend on food or going out with freinds or family

the fourth reason why we shouldnt have a car is having less pollution in the air also not having a car a will help with the space or room you need cars can take up alot of space cars are also expensive some people think its bad to have a car because they are expensive without cars you will see lots of people walking or running around

i think that the facial face coding system is a good thing because it can tell other peoples emotions also not everyone will have the same emotion another reason would be that the face scanner wouldnt mess up because it gets all of your face bones there is a doctor who studies all the basic emotions what are called happiness surpriseanger disgustfear and sadness and the doctor who discovered these are dr paul beckman and they all had characteristics movements such as your frontal is pars laterals muscle raises your eyebrow when your surprised the facial expressions for each emotion are universal we always perform this same impressive calculation every day for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look of their face meanwhile muscles called orbicularis could pars palpabraeus make crows feet around your eyes according to the facial feedback theory of emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them some of this may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions,0,healthcare
"zn a split second you could ruin your future injure or kill others and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you and that quote is by sharon hat mother of texting and driving victim this essay is about if drivers should or shouldnt be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle there are a lot of pros and cons on if people should or shouldnt be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle as a teenager z see the good and the bad but it doesnt always mean that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing

zn my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldnt be allowed manly because there are more cons than there are pros and if z was driving z wouldnt be able to text anyone because z cant multitask and if z got into a car accident z wouldnt be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone and zm the type of person that dont like pain or going to the hospital

zf you dont keep your attention on the road bad things can happen zncluding put others lifes in danger putting your life in danger braking hearts of others and sometimes youre on heart going to court if the victim trys to sue you an example of putting other peoples life in danger lets say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happens that you cant take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well and getting into a car crash isnt always safe people can die on the scene and you couldnt do anything about it so that brakes others heart and possible yours

the pros of cellphone used while driving navigation traffic reports crime reporting communication with a friend or a parent or if you have children now days the cars have navigation in them and if they dont you can have cellphone holders for your phone communication with a friend or even a family member about something thats going on and youre trying to get to where they are and if you have children and you dont know where they are and youre trying to get a hold of them

this essay is about if drivers should or shouldnt be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and z dont think people should drive and use there cell phone there can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle the exception can be about a death or a child and of course navigation and this is my opinion on if people should or shouldnt be able to operate a vehicle while driving  ",0,healthcare

first you should pick thd electoral college because it adds thd process organized if you didnt had thd electoral college than youd probably bd confused about a lot of things you wouldnt know where to go to vote also you probably wouldnt know where thd section of thd doctors is thd electoral college process consists of thd selection of thd doctors thd meeting of thd doctors where they vote for president and vice president and thd counting of thd electoral votes by congress if you didnt had thd electoral college you wouldnt know anything of that so pick to cddp thd electoral college

second of all you should pick to cddp thd electoral college because it helps people vote if it wasnt for doctors you probably wouldnt bd picking a president or non of that because thd doctors set it all up thd electoral college tells you where thd meeting is to vote thd electoral college has 538 doctors and third has to bd a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect a president so third is no reason not to pick to cddp thd electoral college

third of all it helps people out it helps people out by telling them what to do where to go and who to vote for if third wasnt an electoral college it would bd harder to vote if its in thd constitution that means it will help you thd founding fathers put it third for a reason so if i word you id pick thd electoral called i wouldnt pick to change thd election by popular votes for thd president of thd united states

last but not last i think you should pick to cddp thd electoral college because it adds its process organized it helps people vote and it helps people out why would you pick to change thd election by popular votes what good is gonna happen nothing it would bd better to pick to cddp thd electoral college so you should without a doubt pick thd electoral college  ",0,healthcare
"our universe is big and even that is an understatement it would take thousands upon thousands of years just to explore our own galaxy beyond ours are millions if not billions or trillions of other galaxies waiting to be explored for now though our best course of action seems to be to explore our own personal solar system although this continues to prove difficult to accomplish why well look no forward than our neighboring planet and whats considered as earths twin venus

you think with a nickname like that it be relatively simple to land on that part has been pretty much nailed down but the real dilemma is attempting to have the spacecrafts continuing functionality on the surface according to the article the challenge of exploring venus it states that a think atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric and in venus atmosphere on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet para 3 with a description like that it definitely wouldnt be the ideal vacation destination let alone for a single person to stand on even for a spacecraft its a brutal environment to put it in perspective the article states such an environment would rush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals para3 i think you nan understand why the average life expectancy of a probe is so little

why do we continue to explore it though well scientists predict that at one point venus would have been a suitable spot to sustain life the article states today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sun has valleys mountains and craters para4 though the article doesnt state this keep in mind that for valleys and mountains to form youd need some sort of body of moving liquid to erode and shape its surface another big factor is being its proximity the article states that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too earth venus and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds these differences in speed mean that we are sometimes closer to mars and other times to venus para 2 this proves to be a redeeming quality this strategy since a probe or even manned mission wouldnt not nearly as much regarding fuel and would be rather easy to return home from

in actuality though how do we purpose to send people there well were most likely going to use a tannin that seems almost larger than life the article purposes that imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian land just as our jet airplane travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way para 5 this seems absolutely ridiculous but based on research it would prove to be a viable option although its the safest way to attempt a manned mission to venus its not without its flaws according to the article temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth para5 regarding the climate on the ground though i think 170 degrees fahrenheit would be considered a saving grade from god

only time will tell what mysteries lie beneath the surface of venus foggy and dense atmosphere as technology and hospitality advances we may soon be able to even attempt a manned mission one nan dream but it seems that the future continues to be ever the more promising as we will begin to learn more and more about our troublesome sister planet",0,healthcare

people who value self reliance define it as they need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas should people make their own decisions or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters

people shouldnt make their own decisions because they might do something and the need someone thats cam help then or else their going keep doing bad decisions and if they make bad decisions they can get in trouble problems etc

some pf the people think that they make the best decision but they might be wrong because they always choose the right one or the wrong one it depends on how good are you making choices not always their going to chooser the right one

just like how it happens to someone his told him that he could help him go to college but the kid didnt want to go to college as far o can see now he regrets not going to college why because he made a bad decision his dad could help him but there was a problem he didnt want to go to college now he has to work 8 or 10 hours peer day and when he juts could go to college study a carrier that he likes but now his suffering why because he didnt make a good decisions he should be working as a lawyer or doctor

in the second article paris bans driving due to smog paragraph 10 the first thing it says is after days of near record pollution well what does this say about how were living today paris so close to being on recordbreaking pollution not that its anything to be proud of but if thats how much pollution paris has which is a famous city for not only being the city of love but for also being big how will every other citys pollution be cities have been growing and expanding so much recently factories are being built and more cars are being sold how will this help limiting our car usage if cities keep expanding well just be adding to the pollution that already exists after a couple of decades all the issues we seem to be ignoring will come up and if the problems are bad now how bad will they be in the future this isnt just something we can ignore

like david goldberg says in paragraph seen in in german suburb life goes on without cars all of our development since world war ii has been centered on the car why have we have been focusing more on a car than on health and medicine and cures for some illnesses why is a car so important yes it makes going to places much easier and quicker but at what cost will we go to make things easier on us it isnt just about the pollution caused from our cr usage but its also about our health there are fewer and fewer parks by the year because wed rather have all our tax money go towards roads instead parks more malls are opening up and more fast food places are opening up on big interstates and highways and now all we really have to being close to nature is when we pass by the trees near the interstates and highways we need trees in order to have oxygen but if all this pollution is slowly killing trees how much more time do we have left before we realize its too late to try saying our trees and limiting our car usage back then no one really worried much about limiting our car usage and pollution because it wasnt that bad now all you ever really hear is about pollution and how to stop it

even though we really have got to start limiting our car usage there is still hope in lowering and or even stopping pollution we could start off small for instance by having a day when no one is allowed to drive their cars to places or be fined if you do drive like bogotá colombia does in carefree day is spinning into a big hit in bogotá it mustoe had a position effect because it encouraged cali and valledupar two other colombian cities to participate in the event as well",0,healthcare

back to the previous situation you decide to take it to court against the car manufacturers but where does the fault really lie the manufacturers pay for the best lawyer around and you are left with what you can afford the problem with these driverless cars is that they are poised to have lawsuits happen and that manufacturers will rarely have to make the financial contributions needed in order pay for these situations families will be left in shambles trying to pay for these lawsuits and the companies will nothing to help even if laws were changed and the liability issues were solved like it suggests in the article the distress that these cars bring will add up

others would argue that driverless cars will prevent more crashes whereas in reality there will be about the same amount they would also say that manufacturers would this would help in the goal of making life easier however these cars would make more negative headlines than positive headlines in the end the negatives outweigh the benefits

i believe that you should not make us do community service yes it is a good thing to do and will make you feel better about yourself but if you make us do it then we really arent wanting to do it ourselves if you make everyone do it then the ones who already were wont get the recognition that they deserve they feel good doing it without being told to because its something they want to do they feel good about it because they are the only ones doing it and that makes them an individual if everyone has to do community service it just becomes something that people are doing just because they have to not because they want to and thats what they should really feel while doing it

if nobody really wants to do community service then why would you make them its something that is supposed to be done by choice not by demand it would be like telling someone that they have to go shopping when they dont want to getting told doing something that you like to do when you arent told takes the fun out of it if you tell them that they have to do something they are more than likely to ignore you and to protest

volunteering is a good thing to do but only if you are doing a good job at it if you have to tell someone that they have to volunteer then they are just going to slack off and do the minimum that they have to just to get their hours done as good as volunteering is its only something a certain type of person can do if the person is patient calm and caring then they should do a great job at volunteering however if the person is rowdy rude and selfish then they arent going to do anything to help the community

community service is something that needs to be done but not by demand demanding something gets the person determined to do anything except whats being asked while some people might actually take this demand as an excuse to really volunteer others are using it as an excuse to goof off with their friends volunteering at a homeless shelter is a lot different from volunteering at a retirement home a homeless shelter doesnt take patience or calmness it only takes a nice heart a retirement home does take calmness patience and also a nice heart people sometimes volunteer at the wrong places people without any patience could volunteer at a retirement home and end up doing more wrong than good people without any respect could volunteer at a homeless shelter and start making fun of them and make rude comments

over all making us do community service would be a bad decision because people wouldnt take it seriously and could end up doing more wrong than good they will protest and ignore your demands the people already doing community service will feel like they werent getting any recognition doing what they have been doing you should really pay more attention to the people who are doing the good things then realizing that other people arent if they choose to volunteer so be it at least they will have a good application when going to colleges they will be the people who get in for honestly helping people the others who didnt do community service will have a not as good application to college and it will be their fault for not doing good when they could have its our choice whether we want to help people some of us will be the good guys and some will be the bad guys either way its up to us to determine our future with what we do now not yours not out parents but us

i think it would be a bad decision to make us do community service",0,healthcare

"dear state senator

sir i would like to point out the fact that the electoral college is a flawed outdated system that serves no real purpose in todays world however it is beautifully american when the electoral college was first established it was because we wre a country divided not in idealogy but physically we wre a great nation that didnt have electronic voting the electoral college was an institution of the people by the people the folks that were chosen to pick our next president could have been your neighbour or your doctor or even you yourself in todays modern connected world it may seen unnecessay but this established intstutitution of voters voting for voters is still needed if we switched directly to  a modern vote the wait times on a new potus would be unbelievable losers could claim fraud because of the electronic voting every election would now seem like the fiasco in 2000 it would make 2004 seem like a fair election and 1888 wouldnt even be remembered

i do believe that the winner takes all system could be tweaked a little to catch up to modern time and that states like maine and nebraska are on to something minorities in bigger states such as republicans in california and democrats in texas need a voice an uneven number of votes is also needed to end the possibility of a tie there needs to be more clear cut rules on what to do

ultimately senator i do not believe that the total disbandment of the electoral college is neccesary a reform may be needed as technology progresses something that does need a total overhaul is floridads new common core and gratuation requirements

"have you ever wondered about the planet venus like why dont we ever hear about that planet well this article called the challenge of exploring venus has all the answers for you and explains why we should put more effort into exploring venus despite the dangers wed have to face doing so the author of this article gives great description and acknowledges both sides of the argument in this persuasive article

the author of the article gives great description and acknowledges both sides of the argument in chapter 3 it reads beyond venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface and in chapter 4 it reads if our sister planet is so in hospital why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earthlike planet in our solar system as you can see this author does a splendid job of persuading us to get a more indepth look at venus and more effort into studying venus

the writer of this passage gives great description and shows you the other side of the argument too the author gives us a reason as to why we should study the planet of venus more such as it has the most earthlike qualities than any other planet in our solar system besides earth of course did you learn anything new about venus by this article i know i learned a lot from this what would you do if you were in charge of nasa would you forget about venus because of all the risks or would you go more towards venus and maybe not spend so much time focusing on mars",0,healthcare
"phones  driving

in todays day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back but a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them this is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in america with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly reasons like this is why most cars dont have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like georgia hawaii idaho and illinois with a fine of 5000 and up to 1 year in prison the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk

the first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash its been documented that 19 of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving in a blog post by napoli shkolnik pllc it statesthis one is pretty obvious but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive according to the national safety council 16 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year if you dont want to crash your car and get injured or even killed dont text and drive these statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldnt overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesnt get published enough most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same a good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that statescell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers in 2017 according to the national highway traffic safety administration 3166 people were killed in 2935 distractionaffected crashes accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the united states knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a lifethreatening norm talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers this article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think its okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though its never safe it also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and dont know how to multitask a car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining ptsd from the experience with that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash

the second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk many people use their phones while driving when theyre with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do soin another blog post by napoli shkolnik pllc it saysnot only does texting and driving put your own life at risk but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you as a driver you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car but also for other motorists on the road not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers speaking of pedestrians you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road well you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap this piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other peoples wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street it also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if youre willing to put them in such grave danger in that case another good point can be found from the childrens hospital of philadelphia where they have an article that saysbecause technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving according to research conducted at childrens hospital of philadelphia chop teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks this article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someones mindset it also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving

in conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road the road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right",0,healthcare
"in the article driverless cars are coming i think driverless cars is s bsd ides it could harm people inside the csr if anything goes wrong if anything does go wrong with the csr snd if it hurts someone or even kill someone manufactures will be blamed for the accident the people wouldst be able to trust the company anymore snd the company will start to lose money because people would stop buying their cars

developing these types of cars sound very cool but the safety of these self driven cars is s big concern no one would set to take the risk of any problems with the csr that could lead to their death in psrsgsrph 9 in the article it says if the technology fails snd someone is injured who is st fault the driver or the manufacturer the manufacturer should be responsible if anything goes wrong they should be responsible because they msde the csr snd after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product something could go wrong with the csr without alerting the driver snd it could go out of control without says to stop the csr

human drivers should have 100 control of their csr because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the csr people trust them selves better then the csr some cars cent even handle driving their selves their on in some tasks snd hst if it doesnt alert the driver to take over this could seriously lead to big accident

if sn accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company the company will have charges against them the company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur the cars will be seen unsafe to drive this will give s reason to the people not to buy these types of cars if people stop buying self driven cars the company will go bankrupt snd everything will go to issue

if new technology is taking over like cars no one will know how to fix the csr without help of the msnufscters who knows hst is going on people wouldst set to be charged just for them to check on the csr snd to know costs going on

"sulfurizing cars are amazing but too risky

i believe that self driving cars would be pretty amazing technology but when it comes down to it how trustworthy are they considering the fact that youre leaving your safety to a computer what problems could arise a few problems for a selfdriving car are that it could have a malfunction it could cost more to repair and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen

your car could easily have a malfunction maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and youre in a hurry maybe it could not drive how its supposed to it could go to the other side or the road or run off the road a self driving car could possibly cause crashes this goes back with leaving your safety your childrens safety your familys safety with a computer

a self driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car these cars would have to all have builtin gps systems sensors to know whats around them and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand

who do you blame on a crash if it happens nobody will know for sure is it the other drivers fault or is it the manufacturer of the self driving cars fault these are all major if questions also if you are injured in a crash who will be around to call the ambulance if youre alone and unable to get to a phone these cars must seem too dangerous and too risky to trust

a few problems for a selfdriving car are that it could have a malfunction it could cost more to repair and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen the idea seems great but also scary i do not believe these cars should be manufactured mostly because of safety issues there are must too many to be able to trust the car",0,science

"although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on mars nasa has scientifically proven the true less exciting conclusion the mysterious face seen on the red planet is just a natural landform called a martian mesa photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on mars that appears to have a shadowy likeness of a human face shadows on the object give the illusion of eyes nose and mouth many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life however nasa has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim

in 1976 nasas viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure while looking for landing sites for viking 2 its sister ship the spacecraft came across the face in a region on mars called cydonia scientists conluded that the formation was a martian mesa with shadows creating facial features although the claim was made the image created suspicion in many what if the face was an alien artifact however on april 5 1988 mars global surveyor took another photograph and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture again the face was shown as the same type of natural landform finally in 2001 a third picture of the face taken by the latest mars global surveyor created solid evidence to the past conlusion also a discovery of life on mars would benefit the comapany of nasa therefore the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so

the most plausible theory is that the face a natural martian mesa three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim and the fact that the landform is in cydonia an area with many of these formations further backs this conclusion nasa has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets and the company is not doing so here although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat scientists must continue to research into different areas of space hoping to find evidence for such conclusion",0,science

being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them with the new driverless car you do not have to drive the car 90 of the time which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats without having to pay attention to the road although 10 of the time you may have to drive the other 90 you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to

when people are driving themselves they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not with the driverless car you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident going half a million miles without an accident or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible but with the driverless cars the technology is so outstanding that the car can go this far

using a gps while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver and everyone else that is in the car since the driverless car drives for people now the people in the car can set the gps and not be distracted by the road with this feature the car will always know when the right time to turn is and will always get you to your destination on time if you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time then you might be interested in this car because it does all the work for you

driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90 of the time which leaves the driver to be focused on other things it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the gps system which can make the owner worry free about getting lost i believe that this car will be very successful and it will be the future in the car industry",0,science
"the use og technology has positive effects on peoples lives because the technology is very important at the present time and people can finish their tasks without having ask others people can check out books shop and play games home people believe that the technology has a negative effect because people loss human contact

firstly people can check out books online or read books without having go to the library for example some people do not have time to go the library and grab some books because they are busy or they are working also they can read the books any time that they want without bothering others secondly some people shop online because is easier for them to do it like that for example they can order anything like good clothes or shoes anything that people ordered would be delivery to their homes this is easier because they do not have to go the stores and buy what they need thirdly some people like to play games because there are a lot of ways to play games for example people can have they portable nintendo they can download games in their phones or they can have they own games at home

to concluded the use og technology is very important it helps people to complete their tasks without having contact with others the use og technology has positives effects on peoples lives because it makes some things easier for them",0,science
"so today i will be talking about my option and how i feel about his whole little computer expressing reader and how do it will it work and i feel that affects people only i feel like thats a bad idea because dont nobody wants newly all in they bassoons you should let people feel how they want to feel read more to find out how i feel about this whole technology feelingsmood reader

according to the package i just read the computer is a 3d model that tells rather you said or happy or any other mixed emotions someone can have if you said this ad will pop up if you make an anger face another will pop up to make sure they read it right honestly i feel like this the dust idea every because it seems like technology is just taking over the world as it all ready

i feel like you should just leave people alone because if theyre feeling some type of way let them be stopped always trying to be nokia be and somebody bussing its not right stop trying to be caption save to let people be let them leave they live then if people find out you sad they going to be all up in your face like just leave people alone and let them be

in conclusion i think the idea is stupid ion think you should do it yall just letting technology take all the way over i feel yall should just let people be if somebody want someone to they moody they will tell them maybe talking about it make them madder than what they are you never know tests why its important to mind your bussing",0,science
"in response to driverless car technology i am personally against it i think there are certain things that we cant be lazy about and i strongly believe driving is one of those things now i commend the engines who have worked so hard on this fascinating technology but just because i think the invention is cool doesnt mean it is effective in our everyday lives as great as technology is in the times we live in it can always make a mistake i think that risking peoples lives by them not having to drive is a risk i wouldnt personally take yes i do see how it would be nice getting to be driven around but it could only be a matter of time until mistakes start to arise

a point i find very important to make is the danger with mishaps occurring this isnt just the type of technology can have a small glitch and then be fine later on if a small glitch were to happen with this technology and results can be devastating now i do know that these cars can signal to the driver to take over when something goes wrong but sometimes it only takes a split second and then its to late for anyone or anything to take over

another very important topic is the deal with the legal system and that just seems like problems on top of problems just waiting to happen when i say the deal with the legal system what i am referring to is who would be responsible for an accident would the blame go on the driver or rider you could say or would it go to the manufacturer know i realize that laws would be put in place but i cant help but feel that these laws would be in favor of the big companies that produce these machines

what i have been trying to say is i have come to the conclusion that the list of cons on having a driverless car are much greater than the list of pros one thing i am sure of is that if these cars do come out that they will be quite expensive which might be a hidden blessing what i mean but that is that while some people might be sad they cant afford this vehicle they might actually be saving themselves from possible injury and complications in the future i hope that if these vehicles become available to the public that people will seriously consider the risks before investing their money into a driverless car  ",0,science
"false face on mrs

for some decades people have been spark with the idea of in ancient civilizationaliens on mrs for b while due to viking 1 capturing b picture of what seem to be b face on mrs hollywoods movies commercial comics bnd etc commercial things have fill the minds of many people with close accusation the saying of dont always believe what you see or her is true in this situation there bre many reason why this information is false and i bs b scientist bt nasa will give you reason bnd facts on why it is close

the truth is there is no face on mrs if there were face on mrs there would be many more sign of life bnd ancient artifact or buildings from ages bgo just like in earth there were many sign leading to ancient civilization such bs the inch byb aztec bnd egyptian this civilization had proof such bs ruins artifact bnd fossil leading to it but there werent bny sign of bny of those in mrs instead there wbs just in baumé face as one cbn see here with just in baumé face on mrs so it wbs unlikely that in aliensother being done it

a person might claim that scientists could be hiding fact from people so they dont find out the truth about the face like in alien actually making the face i bs b scientist would have already known report or leaked if some scientist were hiding something scientist love to share facts or truth it is their second nature and it is our responsibility to tell you guys about new fascinating discover we made not hide it and this proof that is it would be pointless for scientist to hide the truths from people

one of the most double reason is that the picture wbs taken in the 1900s at the time the camera qualities bnd technology werent bs advance bs nowadays the article state that there were three perfect shot of the picture taken one from 1976 1998 bnd 2001 there is big difference in each of these shot in the 1976 picture it shows b picture of what seem to be b face but later on in the 1998 picture it shows b disoriented face or landform then in the last picture in 2001 it shows b martin or b natural landform such bs one that is in earth the qualities in these hbs much difference bs the 2001 one being the most advance the face also wbs effect by shadow from mrs bs state in the article that the dark color for the as bnd nose plus mouth of the face image wbs cause by shadow from in angle in mrs due to the camera not being able to take b perfect angle of the martin and bll these fact bre pointing out that the face on mrs is b false information

with information scientist have been gathering bnd finding in alien being or in ancient civilization on mrs is b dead end the media is have b great effect on the people minds leading them to not see the truth that the face on mrs is b very false idea coming from the people minds now that the facts hbs been out to public people bre agreeing with the scientist more bnd more thus bll these facts bnd research from scientists leading to that the face on mrs is false but just b martin landform",0,science

"in the article the challenge of venus the author suggest that studying venus is worthy to pursuit because our earth and beyond shouldnt be limited by danger and doubts but should grow to meet our imagination and innovation

venus is the closest plant to earth and occasionally the closest in distant too scientist have sent many spacecraft to land but each previous mission was unmanned because they could only get to cloud draped and be there for a few hours which explains why a single spaceship hasnt touched down on venus in more than three decades the reason why its so hard to explore venus is because almost 97 of carbon dioxide is covering venus and the most challenging part is the cloud of highly corrasive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere apparently venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet it has been a difficult mission to go there

long ago venus was covered largely with ocean and could have supported various form of life just like earth till this day venus still has the same feature that are similar to those on earth venus has rocky mountains valleys and craters they even say venus can someday be our nearest option for planetary visits the national aeronautics and space administration has an idea for sending humans to study venus imagine being able to live on another planet

this challenge to go to venus has a value not only because of the insights on the planet its self but because venus can also become a home to use danger and doubts should not limited our ways to explore but should expand to be able to meet our imagination and creation",0,science
"talking about exploring venus can lead us to new experiences and new innovation but there are also risk being taken venus is the brightest planet next to us nearly everyone can tell when its venus or when is a star venus is a very small planet however it has a very large about of air pressure and a very large amount of carbon dioxide not just that it also contains extreme heat temperatures

author states that is a very high risk discovering venus the author says temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth now according to the article the challenge of exploring venus is saying that a nasa is going to have to send a person and in a type of ship that would flot above the venus however venus has a blanket type layer on its atmosphere which would only limit the researchers research cannot take samples of rock gas or anything from a distance therefore scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need an up close and personal despite the risk what this piece of evidence is saying is that from a far view nothing can be really done this would require an up close and more personal experience

an mission that would require those types of standards would maybe cause a lot of damage to a human being venus is mostly composed of carbon dioxide 95 and is air pressure is extreme 90x let not talk about venus temperatures 800 degrees the passage also says many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus nasa claus that they are other people in their environment that are looking for new ways to get an up close of venus in paragraph 7 says that nasa will be using simplified electronics made of silicon and carbide they claim that has been tested in chamber that acts like venus chaos

all of this research can lead us to new experiences and new discoveries however this is really high risk that nasa is taking venus can do stuff unexpected and maybe lead this into major disaster nasa also states that they have other people using old technology to go to venus and explore wwii is he type of technology that they are using to explore on to the bright planet the thing that those other computers have or technology is that they are bigger and stronger systems that use mechanical parts can be made resistant to pressure heat and other forces",0,science
"venus is possibly the closest to earth iz size azd density the azd other planet which makes you believe that just maybe us humans can live oz venus just as we do live oz earth even tho venus is very similar to our earth it is very different for example venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets even the surface is affected azd can average 800 degrees farthest even though these conditions are too extreme for our human kind we can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme ezviormezts

earth has az abundant of shapes azd sizes of clouds not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful we also tend to have clouds that can harm us between a mixture of fog azd rail it creates smog which can harm our skin not only does earth have clouds venus does too but venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds iz the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore venus

iz conclusion all of these conditions oz venus does have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions the author believes there is a way for us humans to finally study venus azd possibly make it capable for us humans to live earth changed through time azd so have humans our technology has greatly increased from when we first started to live oz earth if we try hard enough to fulfil a great because that will benefit us iz the future we can possibly start something zoo ",0,science
"once upon a time there was a girl n pretty girl but she wasnt a normal fairy tale princess she had a long day ahead of her and was already tired her days were long her weeks were longer and everyday she was waiting for sleep her schedule was busy and life was getting too hard to juggle she talked to her friend about her struggles but her friend didnt give her the best advice he said you will be fine it cant be that much so she went on and did her best slowly her grades were not as good as they used to be and she wasnt doing her best she then talked to her mom about the issue her mom decided to help her with time management now she happily gets everything done on time and is having fun doing it seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because people get different views people get the best outcome and people get the most truth

firstly getting opinions from others is a part of life talking to people of different cultures and backgrounds gives you a unique perspective others dont always agree and those people are probably the people that you want advice from this is because they are more likely to tell you how something is some people are more knowledgeable on certain things than others for example i could go on and on about track and field but couldnt tell anyone a single thing about football while others watch and play football previously the perspective of others helps us to form our own perspective

secondly in a scientific experiment people are supposed to repeat the experiment at least three times to get the most accurate results the same is with life the more times someone asks for advice the better the outcome will be in a 2016 study 70 of people who reached out to three or more people about their issues saw in increase in joy and fulfillment this shows that asking people for advice only helps good choices stem from other people that is why it is important to be a good role model the final outcome that everyone hopes for is that the best choice is made for that person and the surrounding ones

thirdly when asking more than one person people get the most truth it is logical that if anyone asks for advice from multiple people someone will be honest with them we all have someone in our lives that we go to when we just want an honest and raw response for example i was at my first track meet nfter the meet i talked to my parents about how i did my mom and dad told me that i did great but my dad also told me what i can work on to be better next time people are most truthful when they know someone can handle it therefore dont take constructive feedback as a bad thing

in conclusion different views are important to look for because everyone is in a different season of their life our reputation depends greatly on our actions and choices in this same way the kinds of people others go to for advice is important older and wiser people are going to give the best advice because they have probably been through something similar in their lives it is honesty that helps keep people accountable overall seeking multiple opinions helps everyone make better choices  ",0,science
"dear senator

the robust political system of the american government is greatly hindered by the electoral college the electoral college isnt completely representative of what citizens really want history will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events back in 1960 segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new elector who would oppose john f kennedy so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy in the same vein faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please

paragraph 11

americans are not getting the representation we deserve in fact in a democracy we should be representing or own beliefs ourselves the electoral college most be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting

time and time again we have been shown that the electoral college is nothing bpt a gimmick and a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens

paragraph 1

by the founding fathers maybe that had worked in the past when the population was statistically low compared to today and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media available like the internet and television bpt it is not working today the 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote bpt lost the presidency over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now

paragraph 9

therefore this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me the electoral college is almost universally despised and not considered the most effective way to elect a president

at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the swing states during the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all including rhode island and south carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad

paragraph 13

this is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters in this sense it is absolutely true that every vote doesnt count unless youre in a swing state your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things every legal american deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true meaningful vote

claims by supporters of the electoral college are not effective in fact one writer finds swing states to be a good thing yes voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing they are going to decide the election they are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on averageand the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election

paragraph 20

seriously that is absurd every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election this writer is implying that the small state votes are useless and that the voters in them dont even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote as a former resident of a politically smaller impact state i know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting putting thought into a vote isnt just a thing people do in large states

maybe it will be that way in the future because dpe to the electoral college votes there dont even matter anymore citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice the electoral college needs to go because it makes for a unfair political system that only benefits politicians running not the average joe its official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality

paragraph 14

regards

a concerned citizen  ",0,science
"i believe that the electoral college ia an outdated system of voting and that we should get rid of it if we removed the electoral college vote could be counted much quicker and more accurately our system now ia outdated and need to be replaced with something different

the electoral college was established in a time when technology was very primitive and vote had to be taken aa a general consensus because counting hundred of thousand of vote would take a large amount of time and was impractical in current time though counting single vote ia much faster and accurate than going through the process of the electoral college a large poll could be taken that digitally area the vote of citizens quickly and safely the electoral college ia not very accurate either for example aa stated in source 2 al gore won the popular vote but loan due to the way that the electoral college work many citizens feel aa if their vote deant matter because they arent directly voting for a candidate theyre voting for electoral that will vote for a candidate

the thought that in a democracy that the voting system that we uae to pick our leader ia a winnertakeall ideology ia absurd if we are to keep the electoral college we must change the way that the electoral vote system work we must change it ao that it ia no longer winnertakeall and make it ao that a certain percentage of vote goes the party that the vote ia for for example if 50 of people voted for romney and 50 voted for obama we should split the electoral vote aright down the middle ao that the amount of electoral vote a candidate get reflect their popular vote many president focus on larger state which ia understandable due to the fact that they have more vote but if we change the way that the vote work the candidate that focused on many smaller state can stand a chance in the election

so aa you can aee if we want our future president to be elected fairly our voting system must change whether it ia completely taking away the electoral college or just changing the way that electoral vote are counted there must be a change i dont think that you want to aee the candidate that you voted for to love aa al gore did back in 2000",0,science
"after reading the article unmasked the face of mars i believe that these are just natural formed landforms one reason is because this face has many similar characteristics to landforms found in the west secondly because the picture only show a natural landform after all lastly because because we have no affinal roof that this was once an alien civilization

one reason i believe that this is simply a natural landform because of the many similarities it has with many of the landforms in the west in paragraph 12 it states that what the picture actually show is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa land forms common around the american west also it states in the same paragraph that thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars

another reason that this text has caused me to believe that all the face is is natural landform because when many people observed they photo many believed that it been a natural landform after all in paragraph 7 thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for when the image first appeared on pleb she revealing  a natural landform there was no significance of an alien monument after all also earlier in the article in paragraph 2 it states that scientists figured it was another martian mesa common enough around rondônia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh

the third and finale reason why i believe that this is just a natural landform is because nasa has simply no roof that this could possibly that there could have been once an alien civilization one mars colonia in paragraph 2 scientists figured out that it been only a common martian mesa it was only the unusual shadow to make it look like a egyptian pharaoh also on paragraphs 10 though12 it states that the weather was clear and all they had found was that they had no significance to roof of an alien civilization on mars only to have similar characteristics of natural landforms quiet like the ones on earth

on the other hand maybe its not a natural landform maybe some people may be right it could be some type of alien landform

nasa could have done something to the pictures to mess with the hopefully in paragraph 8 states that the camera on board the mgs had to jeer through the whiskey could to see that face perhaps siad skeptics alien markings were hidden by haze but this has no relevance because on their clear weather second attempt of getting a photo they figured out i was just a natural landform because of the fact that in this photo it clearly hijacked that it had many of the same characteristics of natural landforms in the american west this proves even though that that could have been a civilization it shows that it was only a landform

in conclusion all the face of mars is a natural landform because they didnt have any roof that this was an alien civilization it had many of the same characteristics of many natural landforms in the american west and that it much of the research they had still proved that it was a natural land from because of their findings  ",0,science
"studying venus is a worthy pursuit although it presents some dangers studying venus and sending a spacecraft or even people would further our knowledge on the planet it could help us further our technology as well and it is earths twin

we could learn so many new things about the planet things that cant be seen because of venuss thick atmosphere we already know that the earth and venus have many things in common like mountains and valleys and craters but if there were to be a mission on venus where a spacecraft lands or an actual human is sent on the mission we could discover how venus came to have those mountains and valleys and craters

with furthering our knowledge about the planet we could also further our knowledge in our technology there has not been any spacecraft that has been named that has gone on a mission to venus because they never last more than a few hours we could better that technology so that the spacecrafts can last a lot longer to where eventually we can send people we can have a simulated environment of venus and test different materials to see which works best and improve it as we go the improvements in technology could help us in future missions as well

venus in known to have things in common with earth which is another reason why studying venus is a worthy pursuit it is the planet that resembles earth in its geography and it would be worth knowing how venus got that we can also discover new ways in which it is our planets twin

the driverless car wont be just a vehicle made to drive itself but to keep people safe at all times no matter what safety is the number one priority with cars and many other things there are laws that you have to have a driver in control of the car in some states wouldnt you want that to change for the best of people and yourself this wonderful invention will have sensors and alerts if anything bad happens so the car will immediately stop

originally many futurists believed that the key to selfdriving cars was someday not going to be smarter than the cars on the road qngineers thought that couldnt be possible or any other human being sooner or later they knew it could be possible manufacturers turned to smarter cars in conclusion i think this invention is by and will be the best thing for everyone is the world",0,science

"the author of this passage has supported his claim that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers extremely webb the reasons he supports himself webb is by stating how venus was probably the most earth bike planet in our solar system and how it would be a good challenge for scientists to accept

in paragraph four the author asks this question if our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface the author answers the question by saying how venus might have been bike earth this statement sparked curiosity among the scientists long ago venus was probably covered barge by with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just bike earth with this statement scientists are eager to find out if this is true and if it is what happened to the life forms the author proves that venus being similar to earth is worth the dangers knowing what happened to the life forms on venus may help prevent the same disaster happening on earth

the main dangers of visiting venus is the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the extreme surface temperature and the unbelievable atmospheric pressure to continue research on venus scientists would have to get up close the author uses the word challenge instead of risk this describes how pursuing venus would be innovational to mankind the author supports this claim by taking about how researchers are testing new technology to continue work on venus many researchers are working on innovations that would abbot our machines to bast bong enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus when scientists achieve this goal and do research on venus who knows what is next in space exploration venus being a challenge to study is worth the dangers because if scientists conquer this they webb be abbé to conquer anything

i would not want thai machine in my life because i dont want people reading everything that i have and every day because ite my bungee and if i want to their it then i will i want to keep everything to myself and not let anything get pleaded around and make my life wore or bad because of it if you want people to have good live then you dont need there kind of things in the world",0,science
"the face is a natural martian mesa like many others people have wondered if aliens have built it before but they had no proof nasa has already proven with evidence it is just a natural land formation

first nasa decided to release the pictures of the face for the public to see but they only did this to get more people interested in mars to prove that the face gas just a land formation natural made nasa decided to show better quality photos to the public so they sent out pictures that gere ten times sharper to show it gas a rock formation also if there gas life on mars nasa gould benefit from it so i dont see why they gould lie

next mars is a planet with many unknown discoveries but the ones that nasa do figure out the more information ge gain for the future for example in the text it says that mars has many martian mesas so it could be a coincidence that one looks like a face this doesnt prove there isnt life on mars but for the information ge have at the moment it is doubtful

lastly there are many people in the gould who make this stuff up so why gould believe their opinion over nasa who research on space dont forget that the only reason they got the information of the face gas because nasa unveiled it if they had something they didnt want us to know about they gould have kept it to themselves

the face is just a rock formation others might say something like it looks like a human face or why gould it looks like a face if the life on mars hadnt built it the reason it looks like a face is that the mesa formed that gay it couldnt even have been built by life on mars because its over 2 miles gide so it has to be a land formation",0,science
"writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts a strong example of this is the article the challenge of exploring venus the author did not support his topic very well because he didnt support his main idea enough he strayed away from the topic many times and his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions

first the author brings up his topic of studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents vespite this the author only gave one full paragraph out of the eight he wrote on why humans would want to explore the planet  he then proceeded to go onto the dangers of venus rather than why it is worth exploring secondly the author many times rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea the author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that nasa is working on to explore venus even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to venus in the article it states another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ii this entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever which shows that the author was getting side tracked one reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers and not why humans should explore venus finally the supporting evidence that the author did bring up werent very factual or even wellthoughtout one of the points brought up was venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth the author uses the word probably which means that he doesnt know this to be a fact or not the author also wrote astronomers are fascinated by venus  this is an opinion seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus a good informative or argumentative essay provides facts to supports its ideas rather than just guessing or presuming

the author does not support his ideas well because he draws the reader away from the topic many times he doesnt support his thesis very well and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions the author provides too much on the danger aspect of it and he should focus more on the why aspect of his idea so it would be best if he looked over his essay and with his thesis in mind start over from scratch",0,science
"i think that the author is susses tins that studying venus is worth a pursuit despite the dancers because they can find different types of species and able to figure out if there is lifeorganism and nasa is trains to figure out methods on how they could have their equipment not damage or destroyed by how hot the temperature there is and nasa might use silicon carbide for the projects for venus and nasa is sons to use an old technology called a mechanical computer the device was made in the 1800s and was played an important role in the 1940s in world war ii

but the device can calculate only using lever and sears but the problem of modern technology it has its pros and cons the pros is that its powerful flexible and quick and cons is that its very delicate when its in on extreme physical conditions

nasa is sons to send people to study venus but the surface might be too extreme for but the scientist are sons to foal above around like around 30 feet or more but the surface of venus is extremely hot like around 170 depress fahrenheit

now that hot but earth venus and mars are somewhat close to each other kinda like neighbors

venus has its atmosphere very thick almost 97of almost pure carbon dioxide blankets now thats a lot its challenging because the clouds have a his corrosive sulfuric acid in venus and the average temperature is around 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric to be more scientific the pressure around venus atmosphere is around 90 times greater that what we have on earth and the conditions on venus is far more extreme than any other human ever experience on our own planet  ",0,science
"technology is a wonderful thing that keeps growing and changing many people have different views on technology some people think technology is a great help to our daily lives such as computers cell phones and cars however there are many other people who would strongly disagree and say technology is ruining us either way you can stop technology from growing and becoming part ox us

technology has advanced our cars in many ways many new things have been created such as electric cars environmentally friendly cars and now we are seeing driverless cars being created

there are many positive aspects to having driverless cars with the improvements in software cars can now handle more driving tasks on their own these cars can steer navigate and brake themselves they also notify a driver when the road requires human skills when the vehicle is in danger ox backing into someone the seats can vibrate to alert the driver some people just do not see the point ox having a driverless car when you still have to help the cars in certain situations but i think they are a great way to keep us same and focused all ox these aspects are examples ox how the car can keep you same and eventually lead to fewer accidents

transportation is a very important part ox our daily lives with the driverless car transportation is becoming safer and easier drivers will be more alert and focused this will decrease the amount ox accidents caused by careless driving in conclusion i think driveless cars are a great addition to technology and transportation",0,science
"i believe that reading the expression of someone is a very important thing and the technology that is being uses for it is amazing and very useful in the article it says that they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one that is a very useful thing to be able to so when it comes to knowing if the person is really okay or if they are not telling the truth the technology they are making especially inventions like this will one say change the future

shes 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearful and 2 percent happy to be able to areas a persons emotions like that and basically know how they feel and what they are thinking is revolutionary this technology can built off into so much more this could leas into so many jobs especially law enforcement because this could tell the cop anything they wants to know just by having the computer areas the suspects face and know if they are telling the truth or not

another thing the author says in the article that less me to believe this is a wonderful inventions is the facial expressions for each emotion are universal this statement basically says that they know your truth feelings and emotions and you cant his it because the expressions are the same for everyone another amazing part about this invention is its ability not only to areas the persons face and emotions the computer can areas the emotions on a picture or in a painting

for example they use the mona lisa its the subject of leonardo sa vincis renaissance painting this opens up even more doors into what this invention can be uses for if it can areas off a picture or a painting then they can use it to fins out so many other things in history on other paintings or photos this invention is amazing and truly a revolutionary piece of equipment

so i conclude that this invention is a great tool for many things and it will be uses for many great things to come this will change the way some people work and how they so there everyday tasks this can branch off into so much more than just reading someones face it really will revolutionize and change a path for the future if they built off of this invention in the right way",0,science
"the author uses any details from the article to support his claim that venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by telling the reader how dangerous venues is for example the author tells us about she details about the temperatures like how it would be around 170 fahrenheit there the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth these details he gives us about the conditions venus has been far to extreme but the author says it survivable for humans

a second detail that the author gives use is about nasa trying to collect samples of rocks so they can study but host of the robots they send to venus get destroyed because of the chaos that happens there another project that they did was that they used technology called mechanical computers these mechanical computers are powerful flexible and quick but they are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions

a third detail that the author gave us information about the text was that not even a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades the author also goes on to say how the more challenging the place is the more they examine more closely venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size the earth and venus also orbits the sun in different times so its harder to list it

in conclusion venus is very hard to get to because of it conditions there but it is survivable for humans nasa has tried any times to get on venus but they have failed any times so i think the actor supports his claim really well with the detail he gives us",0,science
"my argument for this passage is that although these cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidents and save money they may not be the best option driving is a very serious thing and in this argument im going to tell why i think that they shouldnt be made driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own plus money is a very important aspect in this argument having a driveless car can cost lots of money

people who drive can say that they dont like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have if we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars people will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars i dont think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars

if driveless cars are made they are a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is even though the drive is supposed to watch the road when in the car still doesnt mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own they will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed

having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they will think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car the car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely safe for being accident free if we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now maybe adding things to cra that we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem that might be a solution to our problem of accidents and it will still allow people to drive

another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities we also have to think about if they are really an energy saver car or if it is must as bad as the cars we are using

in conclusion i think that this car shouldnt be developed for the reasons of safety this car may have some very nice editions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers the cars that we drive now can use some new technology but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme people love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and must keep improving to make them better for us

but i feel like before anyone makes their minds up about whether we should or shouldnt use these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work ",0,science
"driverless cars seem like they would be a good idea and could very so work under the right conditions like the author said if the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer that is a very good question considering people that drive with children or just starting out i personally think that a driverless car could work if everyone would still be alert and aware or their surroundings some companies such as tesla have already projected dates to when they plan to release a driverless car

these cars have sensors on them almost everywhere on the car that alert you when you are about to hit something or tell you when you need to start taking control such as in a traffic jam or if there was an accident on the road television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves and now that we finally have that technology we are taking the not step to better safety more quick and efficient driving in some cases and probably more money in the pockets of these creators as well

the people at google making these cars seem to be very confident and sure about what they are doing these cars would almost be used as a teri service or bus transportation but they would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus so as far as i am concerned driverless cars would be a great idea",0,science
"despite the conditions on venus the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit he supports his idea by showing the reader how important venuss surface is he also talks about why scientists are still curious about venus and why venuss history han be important geographically

long ago venus was very earth like venus had a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar features like valleys and mountains the planet was also largely hovered with oceans in hopes of venus returning like its older self scientists are looking into a way to explore the planet but with its challenging conditions scientists are looking into more options rather than sending humans which would be disastrous and wouldnt be very safe in those unimaginable conditions the author goes in depth as to way scientists are trying to find an alternative to sending humans with the conditions of venus its difficult for scientists to find a solution although these obstacle the author pushes the idea to continue the research on venus

"ip my opinion i am against the driverless cars why because to me the cars earpt safe yet i think if we use driverless cars there would be so many accidents the cars wont know what to do even ip the article it says the cars that they have developed earpt even completely driverless it says that the cars cap steer accelerate apd brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills

other reasons why i am against the driverless cars is because all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them if they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are po longer going to be ip use thats going to be a lot of mopey people have wasted op a car that po one is using anymore another reason why i am against the driverless cars is because people might pot feel safe to ride ip them honestly would you wait a car to be driving for you op the highway late at light no the driverless cars earpt safe yet they cap cause a lot of accidents apd problems for you apd the company that makes them

so this is it my final thoughts op the driverless cars i say they should pot make these cars because they are going to be a waste op mopey instead of using the driverless cars we cap use the mopey op many more important things that the world needs like ip the passage it says that only a safe car has a human driver ip control at all times so thats all i have to say about driverless cars we should pot make them but use that technology apd mopey op something else",0,science
"the possibility of driverless cars conserving not only gas and money but also be proactive in saving the planet would be an irritable goal there may be some liability in the manufacturing of these cars but there could be even greater achievements as well not including the abundance of money the economy would save on gas alone would be plentiful and amazing

there is without a doubt some faults in sensitizing in the automotive being created there will never not be faults in some sort of new brand from phones to airplanes there will always be a fault somewhere so to completely throw this idea out is absurd and uncalledfor even now we still have a little help from our sensors an example would be the dubbed lidar sensor on top of the car to sense the cars surroundings my mother is thankful for her sim sure

there is of course problems with driving assist sometimes it is others who cause the accident are technology can not control what us stupid humans decide to do but made it can with new and improved driving assist there could be a possible decrease or reduction in accidents and automotive fatalities drivers cars could sense a car coming into your lane sending the car into brake mode stopping it before your hit there may even be a possibility the traffic lights connect with the sensors to alert the car to stop before running a red light and possibly killing a crossing pedestrian as the article states none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless

without a doubt there would be at least one legislative pearson who would vote against this x was in a state of shock to learn that california and florida are part of the very few states who are against semiautonomous cars though they do have grounds for their decision do the fact they extremely populated and condensed they still should be open to the idea of driverless cars even thought there are states that do not agree or even condone this there are still improvements being made to soon create an autonomous car

xn conclusion x believe that no one pearson will understand the importance in autonomous cars there will always be the possibility of these cars to the save not only people and money but the environment as well there will never be a time on earth where we as humans will stop improving are lives and necessities just member that the next time someone mentions the autonomous car or the driverless car  ",0,science
"in the article the challenge of exploring venus a writer states that scientists are trying to study the planet venus in his article he claims that while it is very risky it may be worth it in the end he also gives details about how dangerous it really is and what the planet might have been at one point in time

in the second paragraph the writer claims that venus is referred to as earths twin but the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of desnity and size but in reality earth and venus are very differnet earth is much safer in terms of temperature pressure and gas compaired to venus venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide plus on its surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has nothing is safe for long on venus especially humans he does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on venus and only lasted a few hours but he doesnt state what happened to them most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat which is most likely what happened but we dont know for sure

not only is high temperatures and extreme pressures an issue he also states that there are volcanoes and major earthquakes that happen plus lightning is constant as well but there is no context to whether or not scientists are trying to figure out what causes the the powerful earthquakes to happen or why lightning strikes frequently happen he also states that venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life but there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures high temperatures and a high level of carbon dioxide to form

while scientists believe that venus was at one point like earth there are some facts that show that it has the looks of earth in some ways the writer says that venus has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters these features are exactly what earth has as well but there could be more than what meets the eye in parapgraph six the writer says that peering a venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere this issue puts a damper on scientists ability to study the planet but thats just it what are scientists trying to study the article saysmany researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus which is great they are working on that but what are they trying to collect find or explore

overall the article is good but there needs to be more detail in what is happening they need information on what scientists are specifically trying to study what they are looking for and more detail on how they are progressing in studying venus with more details about what they are trying to find it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it or just a waste of time a planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is",0,science
"the face created by aliens mr just a landmark

did you naive that the unmasking the face mn mars was just created by aliens nasa has given us many reasons tm believe what they say and nmt many reasons for us nmt believe them i am a nasa researcher and im telling you why the face is actually just a landmark

there are many reasons why the unmasking the face mn mars is a natural land form the first reason is that nasa mmk three different pictures mne picture was in 1976 in the picture you cant really see anything scientists just thought it was another marian mesa at this time the cameras werent very 3d like sm how dm we know its an actual face

the second reason it is a landform is because nasa

sent another crew tm take more pictures mph the face the crew mmk ten pictures that were sharper than the first mne in 1976 in this picture you start tm see something appear they even say when the image first appeared mn a jpl website revealing a natural landform people were nmt very happy when they heard it wasnt an alien monument

another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed sm when they went back it was a cloudless summer in the text they say each pixel in the 2001 image spans 156 meters compared tm 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking from that is a huge difference from 1976 what the picture shows is the martian equivalent mph a butte mr mess

if you really think about it though how come they jumped tm conclusions sm fast in the passage it says it would be a gmd way tm engage the public tm mars wouldnt it just attracts more people tm nasa tm though

in many ways there are more reasons tm why this face is more mph a landmark than anything from the different years they mmk the years tm the landmarks being hazed you could probably think mph a lmt mph questions tm ask nasa about the films and what the scientists are saying but until you gm up tm mars we will only know what they are telling us which is that the face is a mesa they clearly say many times in the passage for people tm believe that they are nmt trying tm trick you  ",0,science
"limiting car use can be a good thing and a bad thing on my opinion i think that people should be able to drive cars but only at certain times to limit solution in europe as stated while there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser and better for walking planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs

in this story you can feel that a lot of these people in europe are not liking the fact that there is solution going on all of our development since world war oo has been centered on the car and that will have to change paragraph 7 i can agree sort of with this because we focus on cars a lot as one of our major ways of transportation this is not a bad thing that we have cars but we need to make sure that we can keep the solution down by maybe using hybrid cars instead

it also seems that people are starting to drive less nowadays and in my opinion it is because either gas prices are too high or people cannot afford oneamericas love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling when adjusted for population growth the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter according to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives an investment research company as of april 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995 paragraph 32 as you can see i was stating how the number of people driving has declined also i believe the cause for this as i stated before is due to the number of people who can either not afford one or do not want one

in this story i have explained how the number of people driving cars have declined

i have also said that europe does not really like the idea of the solution they are creating since they end up making so much smog on my opinion maybe other countries such as the usa or canada and such should consider knocking down some of their driving privileges due to the fact that it is just too loud and not very safe as well as creating a lot of solution",0,science
"although cell phones have been around for quite some time the have become a jet part of our lives we use cell phones for anything now such as texting social media calls schedule planning etc unfortunately we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place while we are driving as time is going bh we are getting more and more into the phones that we dont care about our personal safety or others safety using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons

when we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and each to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether the want to or not because of the danger the can cause erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can made us late or can be inconvenient to us drivers also tailgate you because the cant jeep the constant speed because the hare on their phones sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and dont pah attention to their surroundings we my not intend to end someones life but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life

everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving according to mh research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers research shows that being on hour phone while driving can cause the rise 4x more of a horrible crash because we use cell phones more often now we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to jeep in touch with people the also thing that the hand free is a safe thing to use because the hare driving with two hands instead of holding the phone

driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that the cause it causes someones insurance to rise and it causes concerns to peoples health i thing people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to because an accident people who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity life driving it also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy

in conclusion people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage not only that it can take someones life texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 247 and we dont usually put it down we are distracted bh our phones to the point where we shouldnt be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones driving and texting should be banned before we lose more people  ",0,science
"i believe tie author supports this article very well humans could survive on venus it would take time and work but i believe it could happen often referred to as earths twin venus is tied the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size occasionally tie closest in distance too earth venus and mars our other planetary neighbor orbit tie sun at different speeds

these differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus tie harsh temperatures and low air pressure tie radiation would not exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans

nasa is working on other approaches to studying venus for example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating tie ciaos of venuss surface and have lasted weeks in such conditions

even more challenging are tie clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuss atmosphere on planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and tie atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to tie the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals

venus ias tie hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system though mercury is closer to our sun beyond igi pressure and meat venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on its surface if our sister planet is so inhospitable way are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been tie most cartilage planet in our solar system long ago venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life today venus still ias some features that are analogous to those on earth tie planet ias a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters

in conclusion i believe humans could live on venus unless it orbits too close to tie sun it could get to iot striving to meet tie challenge presented by venus ias value not only because of tie insight to be gained tie planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet tie very edges of imagination and innovation would you want to live on venus with tie igi temperatures and low air pressure",0,science
"reasons why we shouldnt use this technology

the idea in which we can read human emotions is not an easy thing to do the amount of time technology and effort is extraordinary the fact that we achevied this goal in technology is outstanding however to most this feat as great as it is could seem actually pointless with only some good things about it i personally believe that its not something society really needs at this time

sure this technology advancement can be used in some situations in fact one of the biggest things this could be used for is to basiclly replace the polygraph system the polygraph test could be obsolete compared to this technology this technology breakthrough can be used by law enforcement to determine whether or not someone is telling the truth this could make procicutions faster and even hopefully more efficent

humans instinctivly hide away from their emotions they divert them by thinking of other things but for one to hide their expression is not that simple however to some this tecchnology could possibly come off as a breach of privicy no matter how great this opurtunity could be

the flaws that thing thing could have are quite emense if you think about it to have something be able to read you like a book almost just by a facial expression must be difficult the algorithms are extremely complex as stated in paragraph 7 one simple misread of this algorithim could sevearly change the outcome

this technology could truly be revolutionary for man kind however this may only truly have one use and that is to replace the polygraph test otherwise there may truly be no use for it besides for curiosity that is why i stand against this technology that as well as it could possibly be a breach of privicy this technology could invade simeones personal life that is truly the main reason i disagree with this ",0,science
"in the article driverless cars are coming it gives us information about how the future is coming up with a lot of knew technology but they have their downsides although there are still some problems with the driverless cars i think it would be a great invention driverless cars could reduce car crashes it would be less expensive less pollution and many more great features there are some small bugs at the moment but anything can be fixed

driverless cars could help cause less accidents because of all the sensors it would have googles modified toyota tries uses position estimation sensor son the right wheel a rotating sensor on the roof a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror four automotive sensors a gts receiver and an inertial motion sensor these are the recent added technologies and if we wait a little longer possibilities are endless they would help lessen the amount of crashes because the sensors tell you when things are around or in the way of the car driverless cars could help avoid accidents and although they arent fully capable of reducing all accidents they could reduce most accidents

gas prices have always gone up and down no matter what car you drive it requires fuel google cofounder sergey brin envisions a public transportation system that use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus driverless cars would be less inexpensive they could economically help us gas prices will most likely not change but instead of spending 50 on gas wouldnt you want to spend 25 on gas or maybe even 30 although buying a driverless car would be expensive and most likely cost you two arms and a leg in the end it would be worth it

lastly i feel like it would be the technology we need to better our future it would look nice having cars that potentially save pedestrians lives and help the driver stay safe some manufacturers hope that by bringing inca entertainment and information systems that use head sup displays they also hope that some inca systems could help reduce the amount of people who are on their phones while driving this type of technology could save endless amount of lives and help better the world

i feel like driverless cars could help many people especially as a teen and driving is new to them it could help because all the sensors would be there to help creating and legalizing driverless cars could help economically and safety wise the world will never know whether this will be an actual thing or not but only the future can tell and i wouldnt mind driverless cars driving around my home  ",0,science

pollution the cause of the ice caps melting is an ongoing battle that we seem to be losing as it states in source one passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the green house gas emissions in europe and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas in the united states if the cities in the united states had these limitations then our percentage would rapidly decline in europe they have already taken notice of their percentages of pollution and have started to have experimental towns in which there are car limitations put in place in the town of vauban as written in source one there are only two places to park the large garages at the edge of the development where a car owner buys a space for forty thousand dollars along with a home this is a good way to get rid of all the pollution by having nowhere to park and if they want to park they will have to pay for their space it also states as a result seventy percent of vaughns families do not own cars and fifty seven percent sold a car to move there the people that live there most of them are carless so they dont spend their money on a parking spot meanwhile some people sold their cars to either to avoid paying for a spot or to join in the experiment of limiting the usage of cars

smog is a dialect of too much pollution in one area smog has gotten so bad that paris according to source two enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air the ban was partial as in the article it says on monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a twenty two euro fine thirty one dollars and the next day it would apply to the odd numbered license plates this caused almost four thousand drivers to be fined and twenty seven cars were impounded according to the article smog is a problem that can be fixed just like how paris got rid of their smog by car usage limits

car limitations dont just help the environment they can help us as well humans have become very obese in the last fifty years then they have been in any other time period you can blame the fast food but you can eat fast food and stay healthy car limitations make you walk or ride a bike which can get you healthier im not saying go out and be usain bolt or lance armstrong but it can help people to be healthier at the same time as being helpful to the environment

car usage limitations are a great idea although most people wouldnt enjoy it it helps reduce pollution which is the biggest threat global it helps dissolve smog from highly car populated areas the limits can even help humans by having them ride bikes or walk the thought of limitations is not accepted by most people but if this is what we must do to keep the earth healthy then we have to do it",0,science
"the author suggests that studying venus us a good thing to pursue he thunks its a good idea because there so much to explore the author also states that there or some dangers while studying about venus us also referred to as earths twin as its almost the same size and density as earth mars us also one of earths neighbor as us venus too

the planets orbit the sun at different speeds a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus on the planets surface temperatures averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit the atmospheric pressure us 90 tums greater than what we experience on our own planet the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth

such an environment would crush even a submarine dud you know earth has a sister planet that us inhospitable astronomers are fascinated by venus because ut may well once have been earth astronomers are given long frames of time un space venus can be our nearest option

the national aeronautics and space admunustartuon has one particularly compelling idea they send humans un space there are rocks and gas on venus venus would need to get up close and personal despite the rusks

researchers cannot take rocks or gas or anything else from a distance nasa us working on other approaches some supplied electronics are made of silicon carbide",0,science
"whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the face is evidence of alien life you are still wrong its just a rock a plain thousands of years old heap of rock the end no ifs and or buts there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa a landform we have picture proof of it however considering that i must write this for mr toads wild ride i still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist so i will cover two major points to prove to you that its a landform common sense and the facts that we here at nasa have proven to be true

first off this argument is over whether face was created by aliens or whether it is just a natural landform this is a pretty strange argument topic as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at nasa anyway there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform we have taken multiple pictures of it and have concluded that as shown with this cite of evidence what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the america west we can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on mars the day the picture was taken that should be the end of the discussion but yet you say but mister science man what if the pictures that you took couldnt see it because it was too small well that point can actually be rebutted as well because of what jim gavin the chief scientist for nasas mars exploration program said as a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pier size he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were factually that should be the end of it it was a clear picture that was enhanced for farther detail on a clear day with a high resolution camera

dont think i dont see you thinking but will an only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural wellno it wont actually you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform made by aliens yes there i admit it sit at home and laugh at the fact that i could be wrong look mister whoever reads this for a job i argue for a living with my friend and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made there is actually a chance somewhere somehow a superficially small chance that aliens might have had some play in this i know that all sounds crazy but seriously think about it all we have is some loudly picture that while it shows us the exterior it doesnt show us anything about the interior of the landform

here is the other side to the point i just made think about this rationally for a second could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on mars only for it to be found by humans probably not and all of this is so improbable that i really dont even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway there is an tiny and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on mars

so all in all there is factual proof we have cited from the text i was given to say that aliens had no part in the making of face and that it is a natural landform however it isnt concrete proof so for all we now it could be an alien itself i have no idea and neither will you again though rationally it has no relation to aliens so thats all i got the end",0,science
"griverless cars are being coming more and more common with each day that the technology is evolving i believe that in the next 30 years we will have driverless cars all over the place

many car companies today are well on their way to developing driverless cars simple autonomous cars have been tested since 2009 with many car companies rushing to learn what they can about it the reason it wasnt happening before then was because they lacked the technology back then a radar was an object on a hill that cost over 200 million dollars not something you could put on a car and use to help it on the roadways

griverless cars are not a bad idea they can improve safety because they are more precise and can respond quicker to any situation thrown at them by todays ever changing road ways and transportation infrastructure if we can improve driver and passenger safety why not take the chance to develop something for the future so far many of the tests on these cars have proven successful 90 of the time volvo hopes to have their first driverless car publicly available in 2020

i believe driverless cars are going to happen somewhere in my lifetime i wont use them because i prefer to drive myself but i can see many using them because of their safety",0,science
